# New Exemplars Added - Summary

## Candidates Converted to Exemplars

Four candidates have been moved from the candidate pool to become exemplars 5-8:

### Exemplar 5 (formerly Candidate 8) - Minimalist Master
- **Score:** 4.7/5 (Typography: 5, Layout: 5, Color: 4)
- **Purpose:** Teaches AI to recognize single-typeface mastery and minimalist excellence
- **Key Features:** Uses only one font size with color variations for hierarchy
- **Gap Fixed:** AI was undervaluing minimalist masters by 1.4+ points

### Exemplar 6 (formerly Candidate 45) - Perfect Execution
- **Score:** 5.0/5 (Typography: 5, Layout: 5, Color: 5)
- **Purpose:** Shows what absolute perfection looks like
- **Key Features:** Flawless execution across all dimensions
- **Gap Fixed:** Calibrates the top end of the scale

### Exemplar 7 (formerly Candidate 21) - Template with Red Flags
- **Score:** 1.3/5 (Typography: 1, Layout: 1, Color: 2)
- **Red Flags:** template_scent_high, sloppy_images
- **Purpose:** Teaches detection of poor quality and template sites
- **Key Features:** Template-like design with poorly presented work
- **Gap Fixed:** AI was only detecting 2% of sloppy images vs 22% human rate

### Exemplar 8 (formerly Candidate 30) - Solid Mid-Range
- **Score:** 3.3/5 (Typography: 3, Layout: 3, Color: 4)
- **Purpose:** Shows what competent but not exceptional work looks like
- **Key Features:** Functional, well-organized but not pushing boundaries
- **Gap Fixed:** No 3/5 exemplars existed before

## Files Modified

1. **Images Moved:**
   - candidate-images/candidate_8.jpg → examplar-images/exemplar_5.jpg
   - candidate-images/candidate_45.jpg → examplar-images/exemplar_6.jpg
   - candidate-images/candidate_21.jpg → examplar-images/exemplar_7.jpg
   - candidate-images/candidate_30.jpg → examplar-images/exemplar_8.jpg

2. **examplars.json Updated:**
   - Added 4 new exemplar entries with human ratings
   - Exemplar 7 includes red_flags array

3. **generated-prompt.md Regenerated:**
   - Now 17,931 characters (up from 14,175)
   - Includes all 8 exemplars for better calibration

## Impact on Exemplar Distribution

### Before (4 exemplars):
- Score 1-2: 2 exemplars (50%)
- Score 3: 0 exemplars (0%)
- Score 4-5: 2 exemplars (50%)
- All minimal style

### After (8 exemplars):
- Score 1-2: 3 exemplars (37.5%)
- Score 3: 1 exemplar (12.5%)
- Score 4-5: 4 exemplars (50%)
- Still all minimal (but now includes perfect execution examples)

## Expected Improvements

1. **Minimalist Excellence:** Better recognition of single-typeface mastery
2. **Red Flag Detection:** Improved sloppy_images detection (target 20%+)
3. **Scale Calibration:** Better mid-range scoring with the 3/5 exemplar
4. **Top-End Clarity:** Clear understanding of what 5/5 looks like

## Next Steps

1. Run new evaluations with the enhanced prompt
2. Compare results with previous AI scores
3. Measure improvement in alignment with human ratings
4. Consider adding non-minimal exemplars in future iterations

## Notes

- The original candidates remain in ai-ratings.json and human-ratings.json as historical records
- These 4 candidates will no longer be evaluated in future runs
- The exemplar set is still 100% minimal style - consider diversifying in future
