# Final Prompt Adjustments

## Changes Made (per user request)

### 1. Moved Minimalist Excellence from Core Prompt to Rubric ✓
**Removed from core-prompt.md:**
- The "Recognize minimalist excellence" section has been removed from the evaluation rules

**Already exists in rubric.json:**
The minimalist excellence guidance is now properly located in the rubric dimensions where it belongs:

#### Typography dimension:
- "Excellence through restraint - using single typeface with subtle weight/color variations shows sophistication"
- "Sophisticated use of minimal typography systems - achieving hierarchy through subtle techniques"

#### Layout dimension:
- "Achieving more with less - minimal layouts that are highly effective"
- "Innovative layouts: Creative approaches like chat interfaces, newspaper columns, or unique navigation patterns"

#### Color dimension:
- "Monochrome mastery - all-grey/black/white palettes can be excellent when used with intentional variation"
- "Less is more - restraint in color usage can demonstrate sophistication"
- "Subtle color techniques: using shades of grey or minimal accent colors to create hierarchy"

### 2. Updated Exemplar Scores ✓
The user adjusted exemplar scores for better calibration:
- Exemplar 3 typography: 1 → 2
- Exemplar 4 typography: 1 → 2  
- Exemplar 4 color: 1 → 2

These changes provide better gradation in the "below average" range.

### 3. Regenerated Prompt ✓
- The `generated-prompt.md` has been regenerated with all changes
- Total length: 14,175 characters
- Consistent 1-5 scale throughout
- Minimalist excellence guidance properly in rubric section
- Updated exemplar scores included

## Rationale
Moving the minimalist excellence criteria to the rubric makes more sense because:
1. It's specific evaluation criteria rather than general instructions
2. It fits naturally with the good/weak anchors for each dimension
3. It keeps the core instructions focused on process and bias avoidance
4. The rubric is where evaluators look for specific scoring guidance

## Ready for Use
The prompt pipeline is now fully optimized and ready for the next evaluation run with:
- Proper 1-5 scale consistency
- Enhanced minimalism appreciation in the rubric
- Improved red flag detection
- Better calibrated exemplar scores
