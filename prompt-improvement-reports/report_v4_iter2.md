## Top 10 Candidates with Largest Gaps

### 1. Candidate 29
**Overall Gap:** 2.65 (Human: 1.35, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *This is an example of minimalist typography done poorly. Right off the bat, they don't consistently capitalize their sentences. They do it in some places but not others. 

They use emojis instead of bullet points which creates noise and adds a weird indent on the left. Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. 

There's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. 

Then there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. 

They also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason. And then the button outline also doesn't match the stroke width of the text inside the button or frankly anything else on the page. *

AI: *Clean sans-serif system with clear hierarchy: bold project titles, small uppercase meta labels, and generous line-height make the cards easy to scan. The repeated pill 'VIEW' label is consistent. However, the hero paragraph runs very long (roughly 90+ characters per line) which reduces readability, and the hero mixes bold, color, and many inline links that create visual noise. Some microcopy (uppercase labels and the pill text) appears slightly tight in letterspacing, and the pill CTAs are visually small relative to surrounding text.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is another one of those examples of just different for every section.
- The navbar is super wide
- It narrows down into the hero section (which is fine)
- It broadens a little wider again in the body where there's like case studies
I think that the hero and the case study section are technically the same width, but because the text on the hero doesn't run all the way to the right, it feels like it's not the same width. This creates this very awkward and inconsistent right rag.*

AI: *Strong grid and spacing with a stable two-column rhythm: image on the left, text on the right for case studies, then a tidy two-by-two grid for additional work. Consistent gutters and comfortable whitespace around each card create good scannability. Visual cropping of device mockups is clean and aligned. Minor issues: the 'CASE STUDIES' section label is centered while the content is left-aligned, breaking alignment; image heights vary causing uneven baselines across rows; some 'VIEW' pills don’t align vertically with adjacent copy, slightly weakening the rhythm. Overall, solid but not immaculate.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There is sort of like an attempt here at doing sort of like an electric blue driven theme here, but because the case studies are also that backgrounds are sort of completely different colors and then they are very loud.

We're seeing gradients, we're seeing orange, we're seeing very dark blacks. It just takes away from the overall power of the monochrome plus electric blue color palettes. *

AI: *A restrained black/white base with a confident cobalt accent used in links and the closing banner creates a recognizable identity. Thumbnails use soft pastel panels (lavender, peach, light blue) that add variety without overwhelming. Contrast is strong and accessible. Not a 5 because the thumbnail background colors aren’t from an obviously unified palette and one dark tile feels heavier than its neighbors, introducing mild inconsistency. The bold cobalt footer is striking but reads a bit abrupt against the otherwise light page.*

### 2. Candidate 7
**Overall Gap:** 2.35 (Human: 1.30, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is kind of a disaster:
- The DM on the top left is way too big compared to the rest of the elements in the nav bar
- There's not enough white space between the hello I'm Dorna and the content underneath it
- The description of herself is right-aligned, which is almost always a mistake*

AI: *Clear typographic hierarchy (large bold H1, medium-weight card titles, smaller descriptions) and consistent use of a modern sans serif create a clean baseline. However, several choices reduce polish: the hero paragraph is center-aligned, making multi-line reading uneven; body copy on cards appears light gray with low contrast, which weakens legibility; and some small caption text (e.g., 'Case Study Coming Soon') feels undersized relative to the cards. Line-height and spacing are adequate but not refined.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *This is one of the word layouts I've seen. They are going for a left-right, left-right effect, but because the vertical space between the different cards is not the same as the horizontal space, it creates this awkward gap that takes away from the effectiveness of the design. 

At the bottom of the page, you'll also see a section that says "Like what you see?" I think this is supposed to fit in the left-right, left-right grid, but because there's no card around it again, it doesn't seem like that. So if they had to either add a card in the background or have that happy its own section. It was a bad choice to put it in the zigzag layout because, really, this is almost like a different concept. All that everything in the zigzag layout is a case study, whereas this is a call to action. So it probably should have been its own layout. *

AI: *A tidy two-column card grid with generous white space and consistent card padding creates a calm structure. Soft shadows and rounded corners are used tastefully to add depth. The visual rhythm is generally strong from hero to projects to CTA. Minor detractors: varying card heights from different thumbnail aspect ratios create a slightly ragged vertical rhythm, and the offset colored backplates behind thumbnails introduce small alignment jitters across cards.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The color here is a consistent cut pastel palette on top of a generally more monochrome website design with a slight highlight. It's mostly fine. It's not a particularly well-executed pastel color palette, but it's not bad either. *

AI: *Pastel accent plates (yellow, orange, lavender, mint, light blue, pink) give each project identity while maintaining a light, cohesive vibe against the white background. Saturation levels are well controlled and do not overpower the content. Some pairings feel a bit arbitrary and occasionally clash with screenshot tones, and the dark pill CTAs at the bottom feel stylistically disconnected from the softer palette, but overall color use is tasteful.*

### 3. Candidate 25
**Overall Gap:** 2.00 (Human: 1.70, AI: 3.70)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *Typography here is sloppy. So you'll notice that they use all caps for the items in the nav bar where it's not necessary. You also notice that all the headers are sort of like different styles, so their name Matt is a different weight and size than the headers in their images (the AI data assistant). Even though they are very similar, and then the "Open to chat" is also a different style. They just seem very similar but also different, which adds visual noise. *

AI: *Clean, modern sans-serif throughout with clear hierarchy: large centered name in the hero, medium-weight project titles on each tile, and lighter secondary labels. Spacing between headings and subcopy is consistent and creates readable rhythm. Buttons and nav use consistent casing and weight. Minor issues: hero body text is a touch small relative to the generous white space; the CTA 'Open to chat!' line-height feels slightly tight compared with surrounding spacing; button label weight looks a bit heavy for its size, adding visual density.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The composition here is mostly awkward from the sloppy images. The image is just like there's no consistency in how they're laid out. *

AI: *Project tiles are well-structured with a dependable left text/right image composition, generous gutters, and strong alignment along a consistent left edge. Good balance of negative space prevents crowding and keeps the page scannable. Visuals sit on large color blocks that create clear sections. Minor detractors: device mockups on the 'music' tile sit very close to the right edge, feeling cramped; the curved overlays on the first two tiles introduce a different visual language than the last two, slightly reducing overall cohesion; the footer CTA band feels vertically heavy compared to the tighter tiles above.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The colors here almost have a system, but not quite. The first two images have a multi-colored background that is in the same hue. It's not super but it's working-ish. But then they do something completely different in the third and fourth images where it's just a solid pastel background. They also use a laptop picture for the third image, which is a bit more realistic, but doesn't really work well with their more UI-driven stuff for the first, second, and fourth images. *

AI: *Each tile uses a distinct background color that contrasts well with black text and keeps screenshots legible. The pastel teal and lavender are refined, and gradients are smooth. However, the palette is not cohesive across the page: the saturated yellow tile dominates the overall tone, and the dark blue arcs on the first two tiles clash with the softer grays used elsewhere. The gray CTA band desaturates the visual energy at the end of the page, creating a slight disconnect.*

### 4. Candidate 31
**Overall Gap:** 2.00 (Human: 1.30, AI: 3.30)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is kind of a disaster. If you just look at the header section, everything is almost too bold, she's using bold for everything. From Hey Natalia to Bridging the Gap to Product Designer, all of these are bold. When everything is bold, nothing is bold. 

If you look at the navbar, you see that there's a classic example of super-wide letter space, all-caps design in the word Product Designer. This is another classic rookie mistake in typesetting. 

Another example of a rookie mistake is if you go to her project section. There is a pattern where she uses a vertical divider line between every label for the case studies that she did, but the vertical line is way taller and also very dark, which instead makes the vertical line seem like it grabs too much attention. This is a common pattern of failure. 

Another bad pattern here is if you look at the bottom where in her About Me section she has tons of random bolding in her paragraph text. It's like almost feels like every fifth word here is bolded. And then if you look at the bulleted list inside the body of the text, the bulleted list has too much left-side indent. 

And then she randomly switches from left-align text to center-align text when it comes to her email. *

AI: *Clear hierarchy in the hero (large bold headline, smaller supporting copy) and generally consistent sans-serif use. However, micro-typography is uneven: small uppercase labels with wide tracking (e.g., section tags above project titles) clash with sentence-case headings; button labels vary between outline link style and filled CTAs, creating inconsistent text treatments; some secondary text (stats row and long paragraph near the footer) is light gray on white with small size/low contrast, reducing readability. Leading in compact areas feels tight compared to generous spacing elsewhere.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout in the beginning couplet section is not great, but it's not terrible. But then when you go into the "My skills" and "About me" section, it's really terrible, right? So if you look at the indent right after the title. There's a huge amount of white space. We're thinking that the things under the title start a little bit more to the right for no reason. It doesn't align with anything. And then there's this really strange triangular text pattern that serves no purpose In the skill section.*

AI: *Composition is clean with a dependable two-column rhythm for project sections and strong whitespace. Alternating light/dark bands provide separation and the hero uses a balanced text–image split. Weaknesses: the 'clients/stats' row feels sparse and underweighted with excessive horizontal breathing room; CTAs shift position and style across sections; some project blocks on dark backgrounds appear slightly misaligned in width compared to the white sections, and the phone cluster image floats without clear anchoring, leading to mild visual imbalance. The long text block at the bottom is dense and breaks the otherwise airy rhythm.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There is a consistent attempt to add a color palette between shades of grey and then this blue-green thing. It's not bad, it's not done very well, but it's okay, I guess. *

AI: * restrained palette of neutrals with a single teal accent is applied consistently across headings, underlines, icons, and buttons. Alternating black/white sections create clear contrast and showcase work effectively. Minor issues: secondary gray text in the metrics area is a bit too faint, and pure-black bands next to very light sections can feel abrupt without subtle tints, but overall color discipline and contrast are solid.*

### 5. Candidate 37
**Overall Gap:** 1.95 (Human: 1.70, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clear type hierarchy and consistent family across the page. The hero headline uses strong weight contrast to emphasize key words, paired with lighter body copy that maintains readable line-height. Section headers like 'I worked on…' and 'What it's like working with me' are sized and weighted appropriately, and testimonial cards show a well-structured scale (name > role > paragraph). Minor issues: the hero line length is quite long, and the fine paragraph under the hero is a bit small/light against the textured background, slightly reducing readability.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Overall grid and spacing feel deliberate: generous margins, consistent card components with rounded corners/shadows, and a clear vertical rhythm from hero to work to testimonials. However, the work section shows an awkward large negative gap between the second and third project tiles, breaking cadence. The second tile appears partially faded/cropped, creating uneven visual weight compared to the first tile. The logo strip at the bottom has inconsistent logo sizing, leading to a wobbly baseline. These issues bring the composition down from polished to average.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Cohesive palette with a warm off-white base, black typography, and a distinctive yellow hand‑drawn highlight used sparingly for emphasis. Subtle green tints on project cards and soft beige in testimonial blocks create pleasant tonal separation without fighting the content. The confetti background adds personality yet remains low-contrast so it doesn’t overpower. Slight risk of busyness from multiple decorative elements (confetti, star, highlights), but overall the color system feels intentional and consistent.*

### 6. Candidate 13
**Overall Gap:** 1.75 (Human: 2.25, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *They used a pretty interesting serif here that I think is a sign that they have thought about this. The body also uses a relatively interesting looking model. But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. *

AI: *Strong serif/sans pairing: a bold serif H1 ('User Researcher + Designer') establishes clear hierarchy and brand voice. Secondary copy and navigation use a clean sans-serif that contrasts well. Section labels ('UNDERSTAND / ITERATE / REFINE') in small caps add structure. Links are consistently styled in teal. However, body text beneath each tile is very small with tight line-height, which hurts readability and feels cramped compared to the generous hero scale. The ghost CTA uses the same small sans size, reducing emphasis.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.

So, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The "See my work" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. *

AI: *Well-organized grid with a centered hero and a three-column row of illustrated tiles that are evenly sized with consistent gutters. Text blocks align cleanly under each tile and there is ample negative space around the hero and CTA. The name (top-left) and minimal nav (top-right) are balanced but the massive H1 creates slight top-heavy tension. The CTA is center-aligned yet visually light, so the hierarchy between content blocks could be clearer.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *They chose a pretty interesting pair of colors for the green and the yellow. I think it's actually quite good because of their complementarity*

AI: *Cohesive palette: deep teal as the primary accent, warm beige panels for the illustrations, and neutral background. The teal links, headings, and icon strokes tie the system together. Contrast is generally good, though teal on beige in the illustrations and the outline teal CTA feel a bit underpowered. Overall the color usage feels tasteful and consistent.*

### 7. Candidate 52
**Overall Gap:** 1.65 (Human: 2.00, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Hero type is strong: large uppercase grotesk with good contrast against the deep maroon background. However, secondary typography is less refined. The subheadline uses spaced-out small caps with dot separators that create awkward rhythm and a noisy baseline. Project labels (e.g., 'Sunflower', 'UCLA Library') are very small and low-contrast, producing weak hierarchy relative to the large thumbnails. The tiny 'TAY' mark at top-left and the right-aligned nav ('WORK • PLAY • ABOUT') feel mismatched in scale, suggesting inconsistent type sizing across the page.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *The page uses a clean single-column grid with ample negative space and consistent gutters. Project modules are well-sized and create a readable vertical rhythm. The scrapbook-style thumbnails are framed neatly within uniform widths, and the patterned divider between hero and work section introduces visual interest without breaking the grid. Minor issues: internal alignment within some thumbnails feels ad hoc (tape and torn edges shift focal points), and captions sit a bit loosely beneath the images, reducing snap.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Cohesive warm palette (burgundy, olive, kraft-paper neutrals) establishes a distinct personality. White type on dark hero provides strong contrast. The green patterned ribbon and muted backgrounds unify the collage aesthetic. One rough edge: the bright blue UI screenshot in the third card clashes slightly with the otherwise earthy scheme (the green frame helps, but it still spikes saturation). Overall, color choices are thoughtful and consistent.*

### 8. Candidate 54
**Overall Gap:** 1.55 (Human: 2.15, AI: 3.70)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clean, contemporary sans-serif system with clear hierarchy. The hero headline is large and well-kerned, paired with a smaller paragraph set with generous line-height that creates a calm reading rhythm. Consistent caption style under each thumbnail (smaller size, lighter weight) reinforces hierarchy. However, several text elements are on the small side (top-right nav and captions) and some are rendered in low-contrast gray on white/dark backgrounds, slightly hurting readability.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout here is another example of really strange horizontal sizing between every section. So navbar and then the case studies are the same width, but then the hero section is super wide. *

AI: *Strong structure overall. The hero uses a balanced two-column composition (intro copy left, decorative grid/animation right) with ample whitespace and a clear fold cue centered ('See projects' with chevron). The project area uses a consistent two-column grid with even gutters and tidy spacing between image and caption, and thumbnails are well-cropped with subtle depth. Minor dips: varying thumbnail background treatments (some on gray panels, some full-bleed black UIs) introduce uneven rhythm and weight across the grid.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The color here is a fine like just all monochrome. In fact, it's a little too monochrome. *

AI: *A restrained palette: deep charcoal hero with white text transitions to a clean white project section—safe and professional. The outline CTA on the dark hero reads but feels understated. Contrast is adequate in most places, yet several gray-on-white captions and small nav links feel too light. Inconsistent thumbnail background colors (dark UI shots, light gray mockups, colorful montages) make the overall palette feel less cohesive.*

### 9. Candidate 11
**Overall Gap:** 1.55 (Human: 1.80, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is not terrible in the spacing, but it has some problems in terms of typesetting. A few examples in the navbar they use this all-caps, wide letter spacing design which is usually a bad sign. 

They then use a different outline for the selected tab that makes it look like a button instead of a selected tab, which confuses two patterns. 

They also selected a font that I think doesn't really work well at large sizes. It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, "Hello, I'm Hayley" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. 

There's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.

Using an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste. If we're going to make something really important in your site, it probably shouldn't be a default emoji. *

AI: *Hierarchy is clear but basic: a bold centered H1, a smaller subhead, and small nav items. The active 'WORK' tab uses a bordered pill that feels heavier than the plain text links next to it, creating imbalance in typographic weight. Footer link lists are very small with tight leading, giving a cramped feel and weaker readability. Link styling ('Let’s chat' in a distinct color) introduces an accent not repeated elsewhere, reducing cohesion. Overall consistent, but lacks refined micro‑typography and polish.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is trying to be relatively minimal but it's not really working that well because:
- The navbar is super wide (takes up the whole width of the screen)
- The content of the body is very narrow
- The footer is wide again, but the footer is not as wide as the navbar
Inconsistent.

And then speaking of the footer, you'll notice that it's this very strange layout where the work section is really long and the about section is really short. This creates a lot of white space towards the right side. Work and about are top-aligned, but then the social icons are center-aligned. This inconsistency creates some ugly white space. *

AI: *The 3x3 square thumbnail grid is clean with consistent gutters and cropping, producing a strong rhythm and clear scan path. Generous negative space above and around the grid provides focus. Header and nav are aligned and restrained. The footer block introduces a new full‑width gray section that feels slightly bolt‑on compared to the tight grid above, and the left-aligned link columns vs right-aligned icons create a mild balance issue. Still, the overall composition is tidy and well-structured.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The use of color here is fine. I think that keeping all the color in the middle is working well for her. And all the colors are sort of like a nice contrasting blue and red and various shades of it. So that's working fine.*

AI: *The site shell relies on a safe black/white palette with a light gray footer. Visual energy comes from the thumbnails, which are vibrant and generally well-curated across warm and cool hues. However, the portfolio UI itself lacks a defined accent system, and adjacent saturated oranges in the middle row create a hot spot with limited modulation by the surrounding elements. Color usage is competent but not notably sophisticated.*

### 10. Candidate 26
**Overall Gap:** 1.50 (Human: 0.55, AI: 2.05)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is really bad. The navbar name is way too big, right? Like Melanie Cernak is huge compared to the rest of the site. It probably is not the most important thing on this page. And also it's in awkward all caps and a font that doesn't look very good all capped. 

And then the images - all the text is different sizes and different. Some of them even don't have a body, whereas others have a body and a title. They also kept the logos of the people that they work with really big, and every logo is a different type. Again, makes it really noisy. *

AI: *Legible sans-serif across the page with clear size contrast in places (e.g., very large 'Checkout Flow Redesign' headline vs smaller body copy). However, hierarchy and system feel inconsistent: different card captions use varying sizes/weights and treatments (all-caps small labels like 'MOBILE UX / UI' vs sentence-case body on other tiles). The name in the header is heavy all-caps while the intro line is very small and light, creating a jarring scale jump. Line-heights vary by tile, and some blocks feel cramped compared to others.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The composition here is really bad.
- The images are all cut off.
- You'll notice that in the Masonry grid of images, the white space around all the images is very inconsistent.
- The type size is inconsistent, and some of the images are even cut off, which is a big no-no.*

AI: *Two-column card grid with occasional full-bleed row adds dynamism, but execution is uneven. Gutters and margins shift between tiles (e.g., left and right tiles in the first row don't align vertically; spacing below the large 'Checkout Flow Redesign' card is tighter than above the next row). Visual weight is imbalanced where oversized logos and a device mock crowd edges, and the 'OTHER PROJECTS' section introduces an oversized headline that collides visually with adjacent imagery, breaking vertical rhythm. Alignment of text blocks within tiles varies, leading to a patchwork feel.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There are too many colors going on here, it's kind of a disaster.
- There's an attempt at doing a pastel color background for all the images, but because there's so many colors in the UI in the foreground, it effectively loses the effect.
- They also kept all the logos of the clients they work with really big, and because all the logos have different colors too, it just totally takes away from the intended effect of the pastel palette.
- There's also some really awkward examples of color usage at the very bottom of the page where they've used full-color social logos (which is already a lot) and on top of it, they've chosen to use a colored outline in teal, which is like tons of color that doesn't mean anything and in a place where it's probably not very important to draw attention to. *

AI: *Multiple pastel background panels (peach, lavender, light blue, mint) create a soft tone but lack a cohesive palette. Brand colors from logos and screenshots clash with these panels, producing a noisy overall color story. Contrast is acceptable for readability, yet the variety of tints across tiles makes the page feel fragmented rather than unified.*

1. **Add explicit inconsistency detection:**
