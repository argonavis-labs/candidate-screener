## Top 10 Candidates with Largest Gaps

### 1. Candidate 10
**Overall Gap:** 1.35 (Human: 1.65, AI: 3.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Readable serif body paired with a light sans in nav/buttons shows some restraint, but the system lacks cohesion and clear hierarchy. Evidence: body copy appears Georgia/Times-like while the top nav and CTA cards use a different sans; section transitions rely on horizontal rules rather than typographic headings; link styling defaults to bright blue underlined text that visually competes with the body; button labels in the blue cards use a different size/weight and casing, creating a mixed voice. Line length is comfortable, though line-height in the paragraphs reads slightly tight.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Overall two‑column structure with generous whitespace and clear section breaks feels calm, but refinement is uneven. Evidence: hero uses left text/right avatar which aligns reasonably, yet the right‑column CTA cards feel like floating boxes with heavy radius and shadows that don’t align to strong anchors; the education section introduces small logos and a mascot that crowd the text block and disrupt the clean rhythm; horizontal rules provide separation but contribute to a segmented, slightly disjointed flow; footer has large airy gap with small icons, leaving an underweighted focal point.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: * restrained palette centered on blue accents over white/black is pleasant, but the blues vary in saturation/hue without a clear system. Evidence: default link blue with underlines, darker navy button fill, and pale blue CTA backgrounds don’t feel harmonized; the yellow/black mascot and additional seals introduce off‑palette colors that pull attention. Despite this, the light blue cards and navy buttons are generally balanced and not overused.*

### 2. Candidate 11
**Overall Gap:** 1.20 (Human: 1.80, AI: 3.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is not terrible in the spacing, but it has some problems in terms of typesetting. A few examples in the navbar they use this all-caps, wide letter spacing design which is usually a bad sign. 

They then use a different outline for the selected tab that makes it look like a button instead of a selected tab, which confuses two patterns. 

They also selected a font that I think doesn't really work well at large sizes. It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, "Hello, I'm Hayley" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. 

There's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.

Using an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste. If we're going to make something really important in your site, it probably shouldn't be a default emoji. *

AI: *Clean sans-serif system with restrained styles and consistent alignment in the hero and footer. However, the type scale is timid: the hero headline is only slightly larger than body copy, producing weak hierarchy. Navigation uses a small, outlined 'WORK' button in all caps that visually competes with the headline without adding structure. Footer links are very small and tightly tracked, reducing readability. Overall competent but generic and under-scaled.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is trying to be relatively minimal but it's not really working that well because:
- The navbar is super wide (takes up the whole width of the screen)
- The content of the body is very narrow
- The footer is wide again, but the footer is not as wide as the navbar
Inconsistent.

And then speaking of the footer, you'll notice that it's this very strange layout where the work section is really long and the about section is really short. This creates a lot of white space towards the right side. Work and about are top-aligned, but then the social icons are center-aligned. This inconsistency creates some ugly white space. *

AI: *The 3x3 square thumbnail grid is consistent with even gutters and generous whitespace around it—clear and orderly. The shift to a full-width gray footer provides separation, but the footer’s two-column list feels sparse and underbalanced relative to the dense grid above. The page relies on a single simple pattern with little variation or refined micro-alignment; the center‑aligned hero followed by a left‑aligned footer creates a mild alignment mismatch. Solid but not distinctive.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The use of color here is fine. I think that keeping all the color in the middle is working well for her. And all the colors are sort of like a nice contrasting blue and red and various shades of it. So that's working fine.*

AI: *Core page uses neutral black/white with a light gray footer, allowing project tiles to provide color. The tiles are vibrant and eye-catching, but the hues vary widely without a unifying thread, so the grid feels visually noisy. The lone teal link ('Let’s chat') and the black outlined nav button are isolated accents that don’t recur elsewhere, signaling an unstructured palette. Competent restraint on the page chrome, but limited color system cohesion.*

**Red Flags:**
- Human: ['template_scent_high']
- AI: None

### 3. Candidate 13
**Overall Gap:** 1.05 (Human: 2.25, AI: 3.30)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *They used a pretty interesting serif here that I think is a sign that they have thought about this. The body also uses a relatively interesting looking model. But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. *

AI: *Distinct serif display face for the H1 paired with a mono/sans for body and labels gives character, but the system feels underbalanced. The jump from a very large headline ('User Researcher + Designer') to very small body copy in the three columns creates a harsh scale break. Body text appears ~12–13px with tight line-height, making paragraphs feel dense. Section labels ('UNDERSTAND / ITERATE / REFINE') are small all-caps with heavy tracking and sit too close to their body text, reducing hierarchy. The top-right nav also uses spaced caps, adding extra texture without clear purpose. Overall, interesting pairing but average execution due to readability and hierarchy issues.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.

So, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The "See my work" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. *

AI: *A clear three-column grid with equal illustrated tiles establishes structure and the CTA is centered below, which reads clean. White space around the hero is generous. However, interior spacing inside each column is cramped—bulleted links stack tightly and compete with the short paragraphs. Vertical rhythm is uneven: there is a large gap between the oversized H1 and the intro line, then much tighter spacing inside the columns. The left-anchored name in the header and right-aligned nav combined with a centered hero creates a slightly lopsided header composition. Competent but not refined.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *They chose a pretty interesting pair of colors for the green and the yellow. I think it's actually quite good because of their complementarity*

AI: *Restrained, cohesive palette: deep teal accent, warm beige panels/illustrations, and otherwise monochrome text. The teal outlines in the icons, link underlines, and button border tie elements together. Contrast is adequate and the beige adds warmth without overwhelming. Usage is consistent and purposeful across the page.*

### 4. Candidate 1
**Overall Gap:** 0.35 (Human: 3.65, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The type chooses a cool serif and it has a strong contrast with some of the small dates. It doesn't do much, but what it does, it does well. My one small feedback is that the work play contact section on the right doesn't seem as well done as the main text. But if you look at the main text, it's pretty good. *

AI: *Elegant display serif set in italic is used consistently for the hero paragraph, showing restraint and a clear typographic voice. The large scale, tight-but-controlled tracking, and generous leading create a refined editorial feel. The bright blue link treatment provides a clear typographic accent without introducing extra styles. Minor issues: running an entire multi-line paragraph in italic slightly hurts readability and hierarchy (everything reads as one level), and the leading feels a touch tight for the size which compresses descenders/ascenders in some lines.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *I think the layout is a little bit weak here. It doesn't do much, so I expect everything to be really good. But the work-play-contact section feels a little random and not super well-positioned with regard to everything else. *

AI: *The composition is minimal and confident: a single left-aligned text block with ample white space creates a strong focal point. The rotated right-side nav (“Work | Play | Contact”) adds balance and a subtle secondary axis without clutter. Alignment and margins feel intentional and consistent. Small nit: the text block sits relatively low with a very large top margin, which makes the canvas feel slightly empty and can read as under-utilized space on large screens.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *This is generally pretty decent. On color usage, it uses one main color which is blue and then it carries it between the background and the highlight for the text. It's not super sophisticated, but what it does, it does decently well. *

AI: *Refined, restrained palette: soft grey background, deep blue-grey text, and a single cobalt accent for links. Contrast is comfortable and the accent draws focus appropriately. The monochrome + single-accent approach feels cohesive and mature. Not pushing the envelope—no nuanced shadow hues or additional tonal layering—so it lands as solid rather than exceptional.*

### 5. Candidate 12
**Overall Gap:** 0.00 (Human: 4.65, AI: 4.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *The site uses a restrained system sans (likely SF/Inter) with few weights and sizes, creating clean hierarchy: larger bold name, lighter handle, and readable body text inside chat bubbles. Line length in bubbles is controlled and line-height feels even, avoiding ragged blocks. Small pill links under the name use lighter weight/grey to signal secondary info. Within the embedded cards, headings and descriptions are clear and aligned. However, the type system relies on a single utilitarian family and doesn’t develop a strong typographic voice; some small labels in the cards are close in size/weight to body copy, reducing contrast slightly. These keep it from a 5.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 5
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Innovative single‑column chat layout is executed with high precision. Alternating left/right bubbles create rhythm and hierarchy while maintaining alignment to a consistent vertical axis. Spacing between bubbles is even; generous white space around the thread prevents crowding. Embedded project cards share consistent corner radius, internal padding, and soft elevation, tying disparate visuals together. Social icons are presented as a compact bubble, matching the system. The composition feels cohesive from header avatar/name cluster through to the closing bubble, with no random widths or misaligned elements.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 5
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *A restrained palette of soft blues and cool greys is used with intent: blue bubbles for emphasis, grey for secondary dialogue. Background appears as a very subtle light gradient, adding depth without distraction. Shadows are diffuse and tinted, not default black, giving the bubbles a polished ‘lift’. Project thumbnails introduce controlled pops of color but remain contained within neutral card frames, preserving overall harmony.*

## Recommendations for Prompt Improvement

3. **Define 'sloppy' indicators:**
   - AI sees 'clean' where humans see 'sloppy'
   - List specific sloppy indicators: misaligned elements, inconsistent spacing, etc.

5. **General calibration adjustment:**
   - AI overrates 80% of portfolios
   - Consider adding guidance to be more critical overall
   - Emphasize looking for flaws before strengths
