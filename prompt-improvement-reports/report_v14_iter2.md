## Top 10 Candidates with Largest Gaps

### 1. Candidate 11
**Overall Gap:** 1.85 (Human: 1.80, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is not terrible in the spacing, but it has some problems in terms of typesetting. A few examples in the navbar they use this all-caps, wide letter spacing design which is usually a bad sign. 

They then use a different outline for the selected tab that makes it look like a button instead of a selected tab, which confuses two patterns. 

They also selected a font that I think doesn't really work well at large sizes. It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, "Hello, I'm Hayley" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. 

There's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.

Using an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste. If we're going to make something really important in your site, it probably shouldn't be a default emoji. *

AI: *Uses a single, neutral sans-serif across the site with restrained styling. The centered hero has a modest-weight headline and two lines of smaller body copy, creating basic hierarchy. However, type scales feel conservative and somewhat bland: the headline is only slightly larger than body, and the body size is quite small, reducing readability. The top-right nav uses all-caps micro text inside a thin outlined pill, which introduces a different tone from the rest of the page. In the footer, section labels ('Work', 'About') are only marginally heavier than the link list, yielding weak hierarchy. Overall clean but generic and under-expressed.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is trying to be relatively minimal but it's not really working that well because:
- The navbar is super wide (takes up the whole width of the screen)
- The content of the body is very narrow
- The footer is wide again, but the footer is not as wide as the navbar
Inconsistent.

And then speaking of the footer, you'll notice that it's this very strange layout where the work section is really long and the about section is really short. This creates a lot of white space towards the right side. Work and about are top-aligned, but then the social icons are center-aligned. This inconsistency creates some ugly white space. *

AI: *A clear, centered 3x3 grid of square thumbnails with consistent gutters provides strong rhythm and a single focal block. Generous white space above and below the grid keeps the page airy and focused. The footer transitions to a full-width light-gray band with a simple multi-column layout, which is tidy and balanced. Minor nit: the shift from center-aligned hero/grid to left-aligned footer creates a noticeable alignment change that slightly breaks vertical rhythm, but overall the composition is confident and coherent.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The use of color here is fine. I think that keeping all the color in the middle is working well for her. And all the colors are sort of like a nice contrasting blue and red and various shades of it. So that's working fine.*

AI: *The page scaffold is minimal (white background, black text) allowing the work tiles to supply color. Thumbnails are saturated but curated; adjacent tiles balance cools and warms reasonably well, avoiding harsh clashes. The light-gray footer band adds a subtle layer of separation without noise. While the palette across tiles spans many hues and can feel a bit loud in the middle row (orange next to red/orange arcs), the neutrality of the page keeps it cohesive.*

**Red Flags:**
- Human: ['template_scent_high']
- AI: None

### 2. Candidate 13
**Overall Gap:** 1.40 (Human: 2.25, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *They used a pretty interesting serif here that I think is a sign that they have thought about this. The body also uses a relatively interesting looking model. But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. *

AI: *Strong contrast between an expressive serif for the hero title and a utilitarian mono/sans for body creates a clear identity. The H1 is well‑set with tight letter‑spacing and good line breaks. However, the secondary copy is set very small (intro line under the hero and the three column descriptions), and the all‑caps section labels (UNDERSTAND / ITERATE / REFINE) use tracked-out small caps that reduce readability. Monospace body at this size feels cramped and a bit jittery, and the bullets/links compete with body due to equal weight. These micro-type issues limit hierarchy and reading comfort.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.

So, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The "See my work" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. *

AI: *Clean, centered hero followed by a consistent three-column grid with equal gutters and generous whitespace. The beige illustration tiles align nicely and establish a clear rhythm. Navigation and name anchor the top corners, reinforcing structure. Minor lapses: uneven column heights from different list lengths create a ragged baseline; the spacing between the hero subtext and the illustration row is a touch tight relative to other vertical intervals; and the centered CTA could align to the grid for a stronger lockup.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *They chose a pretty interesting pair of colors for the green and the yellow. I think it's actually quite good because of their complementarity*

AI: *Cohesive, restrained palette: deep teal paired with warm beige and neutral text. The illustrations, link color, and outlined CTA all use the same teal, creating harmony. Contrast is sufficient without feeling loud, and the beige tiles add warmth and differentiation. No jarring hues or heavy default shadows; color is used purposefully and consistently.*

### 3. Candidate 10
**Overall Gap:** 0.70 (Human: 1.65, AI: 2.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Type system feels ad‑hoc with weak hierarchy. Body copy uses a generic serif that reads like a default (Georgia/Times) while nav and buttons appear in a different sans without a clear relationship. Links inside paragraphs (e.g., Roku, Visa, Inc) use browser‑default bright blue underlines, which clashes with the rest of the styling and signals no intentional link treatment. Paragraphs and bullets share similar sizes/weights, so sections blur together. The callout cards on the right use yet another scale and tighter leading than the body, creating inconsistency. Overall, restraint and rhythm are lacking.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *A simple two‑column pattern (text left, card right) creates basic clarity and there is generous whitespace. However, vertical rhythm is uneven: the right‑hand cards sit at different vertical positions relative to their corresponding text blocks; the horizontal rules are spaced inconsistently and feel like arbitrary breaks. Alignment is loose—the card widths and text column don’t share a consistent grid, and decorative badges/mascot graphics near the bullet list disrupt the clean column flow. Footer shifts to centered layout and large social icons, which changes the visual language abruptly.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Palette relies on multiple unrelated blues: pale cyan in the nav, saturated default link blue in body text, a soft blue card background, and a dark navy button—all without a unifying system of shades or roles. The blue CTA cards introduce a different tint than the link color, and the brand‑colored social icons in the footer further break cohesion. While mostly white with blue accents, the accents are inconsistent in hue, saturation, and usage, producing a junior feel.*

### 4. Candidate 1
**Overall Gap:** 0.35 (Human: 3.65, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The type chooses a cool serif and it has a strong contrast with some of the small dates. It doesn't do much, but what it does, it does well. My one small feedback is that the work play contact section on the right doesn't seem as well done as the main text. But if you look at the main text, it's pretty good. *

AI: *Elegant display serif set entirely in italic creates a strong voice. The hero paragraph uses one type family with restrained styling, relying on size and color to create emphasis (name and company links in blue). Superscript years are finely scaled and baseline-shifted, showing attention to typographic detail. Line length is reasonable and the rag is controlled. Minor knocks: a full paragraph in italics slightly hurts readability and the leading is tight in places, causing descenders/ascenders to feel a bit crowded.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *I think the layout is a little bit weak here. It doesn't do much, so I expect everything to be really good. But the work-play-contact section feels a little random and not super well-positioned with regard to everything else. *

AI: *Clean, minimal composition with a single left-aligned text block framed by generous whitespace produces clear hierarchy. The off-center placement and the slim vertical right-side navigation add a distinctive compositional cue without clutter. Alignment is consistent and spacing feels intentional. Small issues: the hero line length is on the longer side and the top-right floating icon/nav could compete slightly with the main block.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *This is generally pretty decent. On color usage, it uses one main color which is blue and then it carries it between the background and the highlight for the text. It's not super sophisticated, but what it does, it does decently well. *

AI: *Refined, restrained palette: soft light-gray background, dark charcoal text, and a single saturated royal blue accent for links. The accent is applied consistently and meaningfully, producing clear hierarchy and a polished feel. Monochrome balance is good; no heavy or default-looking shadows. Slightly high saturation of the blue is the only minor quibble.*

### 5. Candidate 12
**Overall Gap:** 0.00 (Human: 4.65, AI: 4.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Clean, restrained sans-serif system (likely SF/Inter) used consistently across the chat-style interface. Hierarchy is established through weight and size: bold, larger name at the top; lighter, smaller metadata links below; uniform body size inside bubbles keeps rhythm. Line length inside bubbles is well constrained and readable. However, the system is intentionally minimal with few levels of hierarchy and little typographic contrast beyond weight/color, so it lacks the distinctive typographic voice seen in top-tier examples.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 5
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Distinct chat-thread layout executed with strong craft. Single-column flow with consistent left alignment and even vertical spacing between messages creates clear rhythm. Pills/bubbles share a consistent corner radius and soft shadow, and the embedded project cards feel native to the conversation with aligned edges and matching radius. Social links are presented as evenly sized icons within a tidy row, preserving balance. Generous margins and a well-controlled content width keep focus while allowing ample white space.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 5
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Sophisticated restraint: cool grey background with a very subtle radial/vertical gradient sets depth without distraction. Message bubbles use two controlled tints (neutral grey and a saturated yet soft blue) to provide hierarchy and emphasis. The bright blue is reserved for key moments (intro and closing), while project thumbnails provide contained pops of color inside white cards. Shadows are diffuse and tinted appropriately to the palette, avoiding harsh default blacks.*
