## Top 10 Candidates with Largest Gaps

### 1. Candidate 29
**Overall Gap:** 2.35 (Human: 1.35, AI: 3.70)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *This is an example of minimalist typography done poorly. Right off the bat, they don't consistently capitalize their sentences. They do it in some places but not others. 

They use emojis instead of bullet points which creates noise and adds a weird indent on the left. Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. 

There's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. 

Then there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. 

They also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason. And then the button outline also doesn't match the stroke width of the text inside the button or frankly anything else on the page. *

AI: *Clear sans-serif system with a strong scale: a large, confident hero headline; bold project titles; small-caps section labels. Hierarchy is readable and consistent, and spacing between headings and body copy is well considered. However, the hero line length is quite long, creating a dense block of text, and the small pill-shaped 'VIEW' buttons use very small uppercase text with tight tracking, hurting legibility. Mixed inline styling (blue links, emoji) slightly reduces polish.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is another one of those examples of just different for every section.
- The navbar is super wide
- It narrows down into the hero section (which is fine)
- It broadens a little wider again in the body where there's like case studies
I think that the hero and the case study section are technically the same width, but because the text on the hero doesn't run all the way to the right, it feels like it's not the same width. This creates this very awkward and inconsistent right rag.*

AI: *A disciplined two-column rhythm for case studies (image left, text right) with generous whitespace and consistent gutters leads to a clean scan. The 'Additional Work' section maintains alignment and grid consistency with even card spacing. Minor issues: varying thumbnail heights and aspect ratios introduce uneven vertical alignment; the small 'VIEW' pills float with inconsistent proximity to text blocks; some rows feel top-heavy due to oversized thumbnails versus relatively light text blocks.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There is sort of like an attempt here at doing sort of like an electric blue driven theme here, but because the case studies are also that backgrounds are sort of completely different colors and then they are very loud.

We're seeing gradients, we're seeing orange, we're seeing very dark blacks. It just takes away from the overall power of the monochrome plus electric blue color palettes. *

AI: *Neutral base with a single saturated cobalt accent for links and the footer establishes a clear brand cue. Yet the project thumbnails introduce many unrelated background colors (light blue, black, purple, peach, beige, sky blue), creating a scattered palette and weakening cohesion. The heavy, highly saturated blue footer is abrupt relative to the otherwise light page, and the outline 'VIEW' buttons have low visual weight/contrast.*

### 2. Candidate 25
**Overall Gap:** 2.30 (Human: 1.70, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *Typography here is sloppy. So you'll notice that they use all caps for the items in the nav bar where it's not necessary. You also notice that all the headers are sort of like different styles, so their name Matt is a different weight and size than the headers in their images (the AI data assistant). Even though they are very similar, and then the "Open to chat" is also a different style. They just seem very similar but also different, which adds visual noise. *

AI: *Clean sans-serif system (grotesk/Inter-like) used consistently across hero, project cards, and CTA. Strong hierarchy between the H1 'Matt Kabus', project titles, and body copy; sizes and weights are coherent and readable with comfortable line-height. Alignment is disciplined (left-aligned titles on project cards; centered hero/CTA) and there are no obvious kerning or rag issues. Minor knocks: the type system is fairly generic with limited variation (mostly one family/weight), and the tiny nav/emoji-style social icons feel slightly under-sized versus the rest of the scale, reducing polish.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The composition here is mostly awkward from the sloppy images. The image is just like there's no consistency in how they're laid out. *

AI: *Large project tiles use a consistent structure: generous gutters, strong left text column, and image mockups anchored to the right with intentional cropping. The curved accent shapes unify the cards and add movement. Spacing between sections is even, creating a clear rhythm from top to bottom. The centered hero followed by full-bleed cards and a quiet CTA block demonstrates good pacing. Minor issues: some thumbnails are a bit weighty on the right (e.g., 'AI Music Composer' devices cropped at the edge) causing slight imbalance, and the tiny avatar floating in the header introduces a small visual distraction.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The colors here almost have a system, but not quite. The first two images have a multi-colored background that is in the same hue. It's not super but it's working-ish. But then they do something completely different in the third and fourth images where it's just a solid pastel background. They also use a laptop picture for the third image, which is a bit more realistic, but doesn't really work well with their more UI-driven stuff for the first, second, and fourth images. *

AI: *Palette across cards is vibrant yet controlled: pastel teal, lilac, slate, and a warm yellow gradient. Contrast with black text remains strong, and the deep blue accent shapes add depth and continuity between sections. The CTA uses a subdued gray to reset the eye before the footer. Minor weaknesses: each card leans on a different dominant hue, which can feel a bit brand-fragmented, and the saturation on the purple/blue pairing verges on heavy compared to the otherwise soft palette.*

### 3. Candidate 31
**Overall Gap:** 1.85 (Human: 1.30, AI: 3.15)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is kind of a disaster. If you just look at the header section, everything is almost too bold, she's using bold for everything. From Hey Natalia to Bridging the Gap to Product Designer, all of these are bold. When everything is bold, nothing is bold. 

If you look at the navbar, you see that there's a classic example of super-wide letter space, all-caps design in the word Product Designer. This is another classic rookie mistake in typesetting. 

Another example of a rookie mistake is if you go to her project section. There is a pattern where she uses a vertical divider line between every label for the case studies that she did, but the vertical line is way taller and also very dark, which instead makes the vertical line seem like it grabs too much attention. This is a common pattern of failure. 

Another bad pattern here is if you look at the bottom where in her About Me section she has tons of random bolding in her paragraph text. It's like almost feels like every fifth word here is bolded. And then if you look at the bulleted list inside the body of the text, the bulleted list has too much left-side indent. 

And then she randomly switches from left-align text to center-align text when it comes to her email. *

AI: *Clean sans-serif system with clear hierarchy in hero and section headings. The H1 is bold and readable, and subheads like 'Portfolio' and 'I am a designer who is' establish structure. However, several micro-typography issues reduce polish: project meta labels above titles are very small and light gray, leading to low contrast and weak legibility; body copy in the case teasers is small with tight leading; the H1 breaks across three short lines in an awkward rhythm; and CTA labels ('Read More') are tiny and thin, especially on dark backgrounds. Overall competent but not refined.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout in the beginning couplet section is not great, but it's not terrible. But then when you go into the "My skills" and "About me" section, it's really terrible, right? So if you look at the indent right after the title. There's a huge amount of white space. We're thinking that the things under the title start a little bit more to the right for no reason. It doesn't align with anything. And then there's this really strange triangular text pattern that serves no purpose In the skill section.*

AI: *Consistent two-column grid with generous gutters and strong left alignment across sections. Alternating light/dark bands separate projects cleanly, and mockups are framed neatly within balanced whitespace. Spacing between sections is mostly even, and the hero composition (text left, portrait right) is clear. Minor detractors: the ghosted background word behind the portrait introduces visual noise; the stats row ('Clients / 5y+ / 10y+') feels isolated with excess whitespace; and some card widths in the 'I am a designer who is' area produce uneven rags. Still, overall composition is controlled and coherent.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There is a consistent attempt to add a color palette between shades of grey and then this blue-green thing. It's not bad, it's not done very well, but it's okay, I guess. *

AI: *Restrained monochrome palette with a single teal accent used for underlines, icons, and CTAs creates a cohesive look. Light and dark sections provide contrast and pacing. The accent color is consistent and helps scannability. The main weakness is reliance on very light gray for metadata and small text, which drops contrast; and the heavy black bands can feel abrupt. Generally tasteful and controlled.*

**Red Flags:**

- AI: ['template_scent_high']

### 4. Candidate 13
**Overall Gap:** 1.75 (Human: 2.25, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *They used a pretty interesting serif here that I think is a sign that they have thought about this. The body also uses a relatively interesting looking model. But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. *

AI: *Strong serif display for the hero headline establishes personality and hierarchy. The serif is well-kerned and sized, creating a clear focal point. Supporting copy uses a contrasting sans/mono-style face with increased letter spacing that differentiates tiers. Small-caps section headers (UNDERSTAND / ITERATE / REFINE) are consistent and readable. However, body text in the three columns appears undersized with tight leading for the amount of copy, and the nav in the top right is very small/light relative to the large logotype, producing a slight weight imbalance. Overall pairing is tasteful but could benefit from a slightly larger, looser body style and more consistent scale steps.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.

So, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The "See my work" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. *

AI: *Clean, confident composition with generous whitespace and a clear three-column grid. The illustrations align precisely above their corresponding text blocks; gutters are even; margins feel deliberate. The centered hero and later centered CTA create a straightforward vertical flow. Minor issues: column heights vary significantly, creating a ragged bottom edge; the outline-style CTA feels visually light compared to the heavy hero headline; and the top-left name lockup competes with the centered hero, slightly disrupting balance. Still, the structure is coherent and professional.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *They chose a pretty interesting pair of colors for the green and the yellow. I think it's actually quite good because of their complementarity*

AI: *A restrained, cohesive palette of deep teal, cream/beige, and neutral blacks/greys gives a distinctive, editorial feel. Color is used consistently for links, illustrations, and accents, aiding cohesion. Contrast on primary text is good. Minor nitpicks: the beige illustration tiles with light linework approach low contrast on some elements, and the outline CTA in teal lacks emphasis against the white background. Overall, tasteful and controlled.*

### 5. Candidate 7
**Overall Gap:** 1.70 (Human: 1.30, AI: 3.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is kind of a disaster:
- The DM on the top left is way too big compared to the rest of the elements in the nav bar
- There's not enough white space between the hello I'm Dorna and the content underneath it
- The description of herself is right-aligned, which is almost always a mistake*

AI: *Clean sans-serif throughout with clear H1 scale and readable body. However, hierarchy is only moderate: project card titles and descriptions are close in size/weight, reducing scannability. Mixed alignment (centered hero text vs. left‑aligned cards) weakens typographic rhythm. Body copy appears a bit light gray on white, lowering contrast on smaller lines. Buttons use a different weight/size system than card titles, creating slight inconsistency.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *This is one of the word layouts I've seen. They are going for a left-right, left-right effect, but because the vertical space between the different cards is not the same as the horizontal space, it creates this awkward gap that takes away from the effectiveness of the design. 

At the bottom of the page, you'll also see a section that says "Like what you see?" I think this is supposed to fit in the left-right, left-right grid, but because there's no card around it again, it doesn't seem like that. So if they had to either add a card in the background or have that happy its own section. It was a bad choice to put it in the zigzag layout because, really, this is almost like a different concept. All that everything in the zigzag layout is a case study, whereas this is a call to action. So it probably should have been its own layout. *

AI: *Two‑column card grid is straightforward with ample whitespace and consistent card padding and shadows. Still, overall rhythm feels uneven: card heights vary widely, producing a ragged vertical flow; the colored image plates have inconsistent offsets and aspect ratios, causing misaligned visual anchors; hero section is centered while the rest of the page is left‑aligned, creating a compositional break. The CTA area at the bottom has small buttons that feel under‑scaled relative to the large spacing around them.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The color here is a consistent cut pastel palette on top of a generally more monochrome website design with a slight highlight. It's mostly fine. It's not a particularly well-executed pastel color palette, but it's not bad either. *

AI: *Pleasant pastel plates behind screenshots add warmth and help separation from the white cards. Palette is generally harmonious with good contrast for text on white. However, the many different hues across cards feel arbitrary rather than systematic, resulting in a slightly noisy mosaic. Some screenshot purples clash with the background tints, and the solid black buttons introduce a new, heavier accent not echoed elsewhere.*

### 6. Candidate 37
**Overall Gap:** 1.65 (Human: 1.70, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clear hierarchy in the hero with large, bold sans-serif and a readable subhead. The repeated yellow hand‑drawn highlights add emphasis but introduce visual noise and reduce refinement. Body copy in the testimonial cards is small and slightly low-contrast against the warm beige background, making long paragraphs feel dense. Line spacing in the multi-line headline looks tight, with decorative highlights nearly colliding with ascenders/descenders. Buttons like “Read more” use very small labels relative to the large cards, weakening scale consistency.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Overall structure is clean and scannable: a strong left-aligned hero, then a vertical stack of large project cards with generous padding and consistent rounded corners/shadows. Spacing between sections is comfortable, and the testimonial grid aligns well with balanced margins. The angled device mockups are composed neatly. Minor distractions include floating decorative elements (star, confetti dots) that break the otherwise disciplined rhythm and a large empty band between project cards that feels like unintentional negative space.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Pleasant warm off‑white base with charcoal text provides a friendly, readable foundation. The yellow accent (highlighter scribbles) is used consistently for emphasis. However, additional colors from the confetti background (purple/green) and varied project card backdrops (mint, blue, gray) create a slightly scattered palette. Some UI elements and logo strip rely on very light grays, producing low contrast and a less cohesive color system overall.*

### 7. Candidate 52
**Overall Gap:** 1.65 (Human: 2.00, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Strong hero presence with a large all‑caps grotesk H1 that establishes hierarchy. However, the system feels uneven: the navbar labels are very small and thin compared to the oversized hero, captions under project tiles (e.g., 'Sunflower' and the year) are undersized with tight leading and sit very close to the images, and the footer mixes styles ('Let’s chat!' display style next to plain underlined links) creating a fragmented typographic voice. Uppercase hero, sentence‑case captions, and playful footer headings don’t cohere into a consistent rhythm.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clean, centered single‑column grid with generous margins gives each project tile room to breathe. Project thumbnails are well composed using paper textures, masking tape, and layered elements that add depth without clutter. Vertical rhythm across the three tiles is consistent and scannable. Weaknesses: the hero block is very tall and followed by a busy patterned strip that interrupts flow; footer columns ('Let’s chat!' and 'Contact') appear slightly off in alignment relative to the main column and draw attention away from the primary work; the 'Made in Framer' badge competes with the content at the bottom right.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *A distinctive palette of deep maroon, muted green, and off‑white with warm paper textures creates a cohesive, personable mood. The textured backgrounds behind thumbnails help integrate disparate screenshots. Minor issues: the bright, saturated blues inside some screenshots (e.g., library UI) clash with the otherwise muted palette, and the patterned green strip under the hero feels ornamental and a bit loud compared to the rest of the page.*

### 8. Candidate 11
**Overall Gap:** 1.55 (Human: 1.80, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is not terrible in the spacing, but it has some problems in terms of typesetting. A few examples in the navbar they use this all-caps, wide letter spacing design which is usually a bad sign. 

They then use a different outline for the selected tab that makes it look like a button instead of a selected tab, which confuses two patterns. 

They also selected a font that I think doesn't really work well at large sizes. It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, "Hello, I'm Hayley" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. 

There's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.

Using an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste. If we're going to make something really important in your site, it probably shouldn't be a default emoji. *

AI: *Clean, readable sans-serif throughout with consistent alignment. The hero heading in bold establishes a basic hierarchy, and body copy has adequate line height. However, hierarchy is limited to weight changes only—no expressive scale or pairing. The footer link lists and section labels share nearly identical weight/size, so the sections ('Work', 'About') don't visually lead. The nav mixes an outlined 'Work' button with plain text items, creating a slight inconsistency in typographic treatment.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is trying to be relatively minimal but it's not really working that well because:
- The navbar is super wide (takes up the whole width of the screen)
- The content of the body is very narrow
- The footer is wide again, but the footer is not as wide as the navbar
Inconsistent.

And then speaking of the footer, you'll notice that it's this very strange layout where the work section is really long and the about section is really short. This creates a lot of white space towards the right side. Work and about are top-aligned, but then the social icons are center-aligned. This inconsistency creates some ugly white space. *

AI: *Strong, tidy composition. A centered hero block leads into a tight 3x3 grid of perfectly aligned square thumbnails with consistent gutters, creating a clear rhythm. Generous whitespace around the grid helps focus. The footer uses a contrasting light-gray panel and a simple two-column layout that balances left-aligned lists with social icons on the right. Minor nit: vertical spacing between the hero paragraph and the grid feels a touch tight compared to the generous outer margins.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The use of color here is fine. I think that keeping all the color in the middle is working well for her. And all the colors are sort of like a nice contrasting blue and red and various shades of it. So that's working fine.*

AI: *Neutral site chrome (white canvas, light-gray footer) lets project tiles carry color. Contrast is solid and links are legible. That said, the overall palette feels uncoordinated because each thumbnail uses a distinct, saturated scheme; there's no clear accent system tying the page together. The green 'Let's chat' link and the black outlined nav button introduce additional accents that don't relate to a unified palette.*

### 9. Candidate 54
**Overall Gap:** 1.50 (Human: 2.15, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Clean sans-serif system with consistent weights in nav, hero, and captions. The hero H1 is clear, but much of the supporting copy (intro paragraph, 'See projects' link, and project captions) is quite small and light, reducing readability on both the dark hero and the white body. Project titles and the small client labels sit too close in size/weight, creating weak hierarchy. The animated phrase inside the dotted grid appears cropped ('Design Should Deli…'), which hurts polish from a type-composition standpoint.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout here is another example of really strange horizontal sizing between every section. So navbar and then the case studies are the same width, but then the hero section is super wide. *

AI: *Strong two-column hero with balanced negative space and a clear left text/right visual structure. The project area uses a consistent two-column grid with even gutters, generous margins, and coherent spacing between image and caption. Thumbnail treatments (light-gray tiles, subtle shadows) are consistently applied, giving a tidy rhythm. Minor nit: varying card heights create a slightly uneven vertical rhythm across rows.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The color here is a fine like just all monochrome. In fact, it's a little too monochrome. *

AI: *Controlled, minimal palette: deep charcoal hero, white canvas, and soft gray tiles that frame screenshots cleanly. The neutral scheme lets the work stand out while maintaining cohesion. Depth is added with shadows without looking heavy. Small issues: several gray captions and the 'See projects' link are low-contrast, and the ghost-style CTA on the dark background feels a bit faint.*

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is really bad. The navbar name is way too big, right? Like Melanie Cernak is huge compared to the rest of the site. It probably is not the most important thing on this page. And also it's in awkward all caps and a font that doesn't look very good all capped. 

And then the images - all the text is different sizes and different. Some of them even don't have a body, whereas others have a body and a title. They also kept the logos of the people that they work with really big, and every logo is a different type. Again, makes it really noisy. *

AI: *Uses a clean sans-serif with clear size steps, but hierarchy and rhythm are inconsistent across tiles. Example: the 'Checkout Flow Redesign' headline is oversized and tightly spaced compared to the much smaller 'MOBILE UX / UI' tag, creating a jarring jump. In the top row, headings like 'Expungement Service' vs. 'Candidate Stories' have different sizes/weights and baseline alignment, and the small uppercase tags (e.g., 'PRODUCT STRATEGY') vary in letter-spacing and visual weight. Repeated thin horizontal rules vary in proximity to text, weakening typographic structure.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The composition here is really bad.
- The images are all cut off.
- You'll notice that in the Masonry grid of images, the white space around all the images is very inconsistent.
- The type size is inconsistent, and some of the images are even cut off, which is a big no-no.*

AI: *Overall grid feels irregular and busy. The top section uses two equal columns, then shifts to a wide full-width card with a phone mockup floating on the right edge, breaking alignment and gutters. Gaps between tiles change noticeably from row to row; some content sits very close to card edges while other blocks have generous padding. The 'OTHER PROJECTS' area uses oversized type that collides with the surrounding imagery and does not align with the grid above, disrupting visual rhythm. Several internal card compositions feel cramped, with elements cropped near edges.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There are too many colors going on here, it's kind of a disaster.
- There's an attempt at doing a pastel color background for all the images, but because there's so many colors in the UI in the foreground, it effectively loses the effect.
- They also kept all the logos of the clients they work with really big, and because all the logos have different colors too, it just totally takes away from the intended effect of the pastel palette.
- There's also some really awkward examples of color usage at the very bottom of the page where they've used full-color social logos (which is already a lot) and on top of it, they've chosen to use a colored outline in teal, which is like tons of color that doesn't mean anything and in a place where it's probably not very important to draw attention to. *

AI: *Pastel background panels (light blue, peach, pale teal) attempt cohesion but clash with the varied colors inside screenshots and logos, producing a scattered palette. The strong purple section combined with teal and peach lacks a clear primary/secondary system. Accent elements (e.g., 'social change' tags, green dot in GoodHire card) introduce additional hues without clear hierarchy, resulting in visual noise rather than a deliberate scheme.*

- Occurred in 1 candidates: 4

**Sloppiness Blindness:**
- Occurred in 4 candidates: 11, 13, 31, 25

**Inconsistency Blindness:**
- Occurred in 2 candidates: 11, 29

## Recommendations for Prompt Improvement

1. **Add explicit inconsistency detection:**
   - AI is missing width/alignment inconsistencies between sections
   - Add specific guidance about checking cross-section consistency

3. **Define 'sloppy' indicators:**
   - AI sees 'clean' where humans see 'sloppy'
   - List specific sloppy indicators: misaligned elements, inconsistent spacing, etc.
