## Top 10 Candidates with Largest Gaps

### 1. Candidate 11
**Overall Gap:** 1.55 (Human: 1.80, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is not terrible in the spacing, but it has some problems in terms of typesetting. A few examples in the navbar they use this all-caps, wide letter spacing design which is usually a bad sign. 

They then use a different outline for the selected tab that makes it look like a button instead of a selected tab, which confuses two patterns. 

They also selected a font that I think doesn't really work well at large sizes. It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, "Hello, I'm Hayley" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. 

There's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.

Using an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste. If we're going to make something really important in your site, it probably shouldn't be a default emoji. *

AI: *Clean, restrained use of a single sans-serif gives clarity and avoids noise. The hero ('Hello, I’m Haley!') is modestly bold with lighter gray subcopy, creating basic hierarchy. However, the type scale feels timid for desktop—heading size is close to body size, and the center‑aligned hero lines have tight vertical spacing that flattens hierarchy. Navigation uses small all‑caps in a bordered pill and standard links in the footer; nothing feels considered as a signature typographic system. Overall competent but not distinctive.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is trying to be relatively minimal but it's not really working that well because:
- The navbar is super wide (takes up the whole width of the screen)
- The content of the body is very narrow
- The footer is wide again, but the footer is not as wide as the navbar
Inconsistent.

And then speaking of the footer, you'll notice that it's this very strange layout where the work section is really long and the about section is really short. This creates a lot of white space towards the right side. Work and about are top-aligned, but then the social icons are center-aligned. This inconsistency creates some ugly white space. *

AI: *The page is structured around a tight 3×3 square tile grid with consistent gutters and equal dimensions, producing a strong focal area and rhythm. Generous white space above and around the grid keeps the page airy. The top-left logo and top-right nav balance the header, and the soft gray footer creates a clear section break. Minor issues: the centered grid and multi-column footer don’t share a common column system, so global alignment feels a bit disconnected; hero copy could use more breathing room and size contrast. Still, the composition reads clean and intentional.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The use of color here is fine. I think that keeping all the color in the middle is working well for her. And all the colors are sort of like a nice contrasting blue and red and various shades of it. So that's working fine.*

AI: *UI shell is mostly monochrome with a light gray footer—safe and unobtrusive. The work tiles introduce very saturated, varied colors (teal, orange, blue, magenta), which adds energy but lacks a cohesive palette; hues feel independent rather than curated. The lone accent link color in the hero gets visually overpowered by the bright tile grid. Shadows and tints are minimal and mostly default. Overall acceptable but not refined.*

**Red Flags:**
- Human: ['template_scent_high']
- AI: None

### 2. Candidate 13
**Overall Gap:** 1.40 (Human: 2.25, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *They used a pretty interesting serif here that I think is a sign that they have thought about this. The body also uses a relatively interesting looking model. But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. *

AI: *Distinctive display serif for the H1 (“User Researcher + Designer”) and name mark creates a clear personality, paired with a clean sans-serif for body and UI elements. Hierarchy is evident, but the scale jumps are too extreme: the H1 is very large while the body/caption text in the three columns is quite small with tight line-height, making it feel cramped and hard to read. The small, letter‑spaced all-caps in the top-right nav and section labels (“UNDERSTAND/ITERATE/REFINE”) reads micro-sized and reduces legibility. Overall, the pairing is intentional, but readability issues and inconsistent scale lower the craft.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.

So, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The "See my work" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. *

AI: *Clean, intentional grid: centered hero followed by a balanced three‑column section with consistent gutters and equal-sized illustration tiles above each column. White space around the hero is generous and creates a strong focal point; alignment between columns is tidy and the CTA is centered, maintaining symmetry. Minor weaknesses: the dense bullet lists create heavy, uneven column heights and the spacing between illustration, subheading, and body could breathe a bit more.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *They chose a pretty interesting pair of colors for the green and the yellow. I think it's actually quite good because of their complementarity*

AI: *Restrained palette used well: a single teal accent applied to logo, links, bullets, and button outline, paired with warm cream illustration backgrounds. The limited colors are harmonious and cohesive across elements. Contrast is mostly solid, though some small grey body text appears slightly low-contrast in the columns, which undercuts polish.*

### 3. Candidate 12
**Overall Gap:** 0.65 (Human: 4.65, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Crisp sans-serif system/Inter-like type used consistently across the page. Hierarchy is clear: bold, larger name/header; smaller, readable body copy inside pill chat bubbles; secondary metadata in lighter gray. Line length within bubbles is controlled and comfortable, with generous internal padding that keeps blocks airy. Contrast is mostly strong (white on blue, dark gray on light gray). Minor nits: some micro text in link rows and card captions trends small, and a few gray-on-gray lines push contrast limits slightly.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Distinctive chat-conversation layout executed with discipline. Bubbles share a consistent corner radius, spacing, and shadow treatment, creating rhythm. The central column aligns well; project cards drop into the flow with matching radii and image cropping, tying elements together. Whitespace is generous and the page feels coherent from top to bottom. Small issues: the dark social icon tiles feel weight-heavy compared to the otherwise light UI, a few bubble–card transitions are a touch tight, and the left-anchored column leaves large unused space on wide screens, slightly affecting balance.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Restrained cool palette: soft neutrals with a single saturated blue accent for primary bubbles/CTA. Subtle background gradient adds depth without noise; shadows appear hue-tinted rather than default black, which feels intentional. Project imagery introduces controlled pops while staying within the cool spectrum. Minor mismatch: brand-colored social icons in dark squares disrupt the otherwise cohesive, airy palette.*

### 4. Candidate 1
**Overall Gap:** 0.35 (Human: 3.65, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The type chooses a cool serif and it has a strong contrast with some of the small dates. It doesn't do much, but what it does, it does well. My one small feedback is that the work play contact section on the right doesn't seem as well done as the main text. But if you look at the main text, it's pretty good. *

AI: *The hero uses a high‑contrast editorial serif in italics with confident scale and generous margins, creating a distinct voice. Inline blue links provide emphasis without adding extra styles, and the ragged-left paragraph is controlled and elegant. However, setting the entire multi-line paragraph in italics slightly hurts readability and hierarchy (everything has the same style/weight), and the line-height feels a touch tight for such large, slanted characters, causing descenders and ascenders to visually crowd between lines.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *I think the layout is a little bit weak here. It doesn't do much, so I expect everything to be really good. But the work-play-contact section feels a little random and not super well-positioned with regard to everything else. *

AI: *Strong, minimal composition: a single large text block is placed slightly left of center with ample whitespace around it, producing a clear focal point. The vertical right-edge navigation (rotated labels and thin divider) adds a refined secondary axis and visual tension while maintaining alignment. Spacing appears consistent and restrained. Minor nit: the large empty regions border on over-empty, and the text measure runs long for a hero paragraph, which softens the crispness of the grid.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *This is generally pretty decent. On color usage, it uses one main color which is blue and then it carries it between the background and the highlight for the text. It's not super sophisticated, but what it does, it does decently well. *

AI: *A restrained palette of soft gray background, deep charcoal text, and a single saturated blue accent creates harmony and clear emphasis. The accent is used sparingly for key inline links, which reads intentional and controlled. Monochrome balance is good with no harsh pure blacks. Could be pushed further with subtle tonal variation for secondary metadata to strengthen hierarchy.*

### 5. Candidate 10
**Overall Gap:** 0.35 (Human: 1.65, AI: 2.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Primarily a default-looking serif (similar to Georgia/Times) for all body copy with minimal hierarchy; headings read nearly the same size and weight as body text, relying on horizontal rules rather than type scale for sectioning. Navigation appears in a different sans-serif, creating an unintentional pairing that isn’t carried through elsewhere. Links use default bright blue with underlines, which clashes with the button styles and adds visual noise. Line length is acceptable, but overall rhythm and scale feel undeveloped.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Two-column blocks with text left and a small avatar or CTA card on the right show intent, but alignment and rhythm are inconsistent. The right-side cards float without shared baseline or edge alignment to the text column, creating imbalance. Large full-width dividers interrupt flow and feel heavy. The final 'Let’s connect' section switches to center alignment and different widths, breaking the grid. Spacing between paragraphs, cards, and dividers varies, leading to a choppy reading experience.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *A minimal white-and-blue approach shows restraint, but execution lacks cohesion. Multiple blues are used (default link blue, darker button blue, pale blue card background) without a clear system, and shadows on the cards feel stock. Small accent illustrations introduce unrelated colors that aren’t integrated into the palette. Overall the color choices are serviceable but not refined.*

## Recommendations for Prompt Improvement

3. **Define 'sloppy' indicators:**
   - AI sees 'clean' where humans see 'sloppy'
   - List specific sloppy indicators: misaligned elements, inconsistent spacing, etc.

5. **General calibration adjustment:**
   - AI overrates 80% of portfolios
   - Consider adding guidance to be more critical overall
   - Emphasize looking for flaws before strengths
