## Top 10 Candidates with Largest Gaps

### 1. Candidate 29
**Overall Gap:** 2.35 (Human: 1.35, AI: 3.70)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *This is an example of minimalist typography done poorly. Right off the bat, they don't consistently capitalize their sentences. They do it in some places but not others. 

They use emojis instead of bullet points which creates noise and adds a weird indent on the left. Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. 

There's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. 

Then there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. 

They also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason. And then the button outline also doesn't match the stroke width of the text inside the button or frankly anything else on the page. *

AI: *Clean sans-serif system with clear hierarchy: large, well-spaced intro headline; section labels in tight small-caps/letterspaced style (“CASE STUDIES”, “ADDITIONAL WORK”) create structure; project titles have strong weight contrast over lighter metadata. Body copy line length and leading are comfortable and readable. Minor issues keep it from a 5: the hero block mixes multiple treatments (blue links, emojis, and varying weights) that create a slightly busy texture; the thin-stroked 'VIEW' pill feels under-weighted relative to nearby headings; link underlines vary in emphasis compared to other typographic accents.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is another one of those examples of just different for every section.
- The navbar is super wide
- It narrows down into the hero section (which is fine)
- It broadens a little wider again in the body where there's like case studies
I think that the hero and the case study section are technically the same width, but because the text on the hero doesn't run all the way to the right, it feels like it's not the same width. This creates this very awkward and inconsistent right rag.*

AI: *Consistent, balanced rhythm using an image–text pairing that alternates down the page. Strong alignment and generous negative space provide clarity; gutters between image cards are even, and the two-column grid in the 'Additional work' section is well-balanced. Visual hierarchy is clear from hero to case studies to secondary work. Minor composition quirks: thumbnail heights vary and create uneven vertical anchors; one very dark thumbnail visually outweighs neighboring pastel tiles; the saturated full-width footer band is heavy and competes with page content on scroll end.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There is sort of like an attempt here at doing sort of like an electric blue driven theme here, but because the case studies are also that backgrounds are sort of completely different colors and then they are very loud.

We're seeing gradients, we're seeing orange, we're seeing very dark blacks. It just takes away from the overall power of the monochrome plus electric blue color palettes. *

AI: *Neutral base with a defined electric-blue accent offers good contrast and recognizability. However, color cohesion is average: project thumbnails mix pastel backplates, a very dark tile, and a gradient card, producing inconsistent saturation and visual weight from row to row. The bright footer blue is much more saturated than most elements and feels disconnected from the otherwise light palette. Unifying thumbnail backplates or applying a consistent tint would improve harmony.*

### 2. Candidate 25
**Overall Gap:** 2.30 (Human: 1.70, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *Typography here is sloppy. So you'll notice that they use all caps for the items in the nav bar where it's not necessary. You also notice that all the headers are sort of like different styles, so their name Matt is a different weight and size than the headers in their images (the AI data assistant). Even though they are very similar, and then the "Open to chat" is also a different style. They just seem very similar but also different, which adds visual noise. *

AI: *Consistent use of a clean sans-serif with clear hierarchy between hero name, project titles, and small labels. Project titles are bold and left‑aligned, creating strong scannability against spacious backgrounds. Body copy and captions maintain consistent sizing and weight. Minor issues keep it from fantastic: the hero paragraph runs very long (wide measure, ~90–100+ characters), the 'Open to chat!' headline feels oversized relative to project titles, and button typography (small rounded pill) feels slightly under-weight compared to surrounding text.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The composition here is mostly awkward from the sloppy images. The image is just like there's no consistency in how they're laid out. *

AI: *A disciplined grid with generous whitespace and consistent left alignment across sections. Large project tiles use a reliable pattern: title/caption on the left with imagery anchored to the right, producing a clean reading rhythm. Spacing between sections is even and the visual rhythm is maintained down the page. The overlapping arc shapes add controlled dynamism without clutter. Small drawbacks: occasional large negative space on the left within tiles creates slight imbalance, the CTA band's centered layout interrupts the otherwise left‑aligned flow, and the footer line/nav feel visually light compared to the rest of the page.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The colors here almost have a system, but not quite. The first two images have a multi-colored background that is in the same hue. It's not super but it's working-ish. But then they do something completely different in the third and fourth images where it's just a solid pastel background. They also use a laptop picture for the third image, which is a bit more realistic, but doesn't really work well with their more UI-driven stuff for the first, second, and fourth images. *

AI: *Cohesive palette using soft tints (teal, lavender, light gray, yellow) paired with deep blues for contrast. Black text on light fields maintains readability; imagery sits well on the color blocks with subtle depth from gradients and shadows. Color choices differentiate each project while feeling part of a system. Minor issues: the yellow case approaches lower contrast for smaller labels, and the CTA band’s gray-on-gray feels a bit muted compared to the vivid project panels.*

### 3. Candidate 52
**Overall Gap:** 2.00 (Human: 2.00, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Strong typographic hierarchy anchored by a large, tightly tracked all-caps hero headline that feels confident and well-kerned. Subhead in small caps with generous letter-spacing complements the hero. Navigation is minimal and clean. Project captions use a smaller sans with clear hierarchy between title and description. Minor issues: micro-size body/caption text feels a touch too small and low-contrast in places; project labels (e.g., 'Sunflower' vs. 'Xbox') show slight inconsistency in weight and styling, and the tiny 'TAY' wordmark is almost too subtle for the scale.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clear single-column rhythm with generous whitespace allows the eye to scan easily. The full-bleed hero with patterned divider establishes a distinct art direction, and projects are consistently framed and centered with comfortable breathing room. Thumbnails are well-cropped and aligned, and the footer splits into two columns cleanly. Small nitpicks: spacing between image blocks and captions isn’t perfectly uniform, and the collage/tape elements occasionally introduce slight visual clutter that interrupts the otherwise strict grid.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Cohesive, characterful palette: deep maroon hero with high-contrast white type, paired with muted greens and paper textures creates a warm, crafted feel. The patterned cat border adds personality without breaking contrast. Project thumbnails maintain a muted, tactile color story that feels consistent across the page. At times the combination of multiple textured hues (maroon, green, beige) can feel a bit busy, but overall the palette is intentional and controlled.*

### 4. Candidate 26
**Overall Gap:** 1.85 (Human: 0.55, AI: 2.40)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is really bad. The navbar name is way too big, right? Like Melanie Cernak is huge compared to the rest of the site. It probably is not the most important thing on this page. And also it's in awkward all caps and a font that doesn't look very good all capped. 

And then the images - all the text is different sizes and different. Some of them even don't have a body, whereas others have a body and a title. They also kept the logos of the people that they work with really big, and every logo is a different type. Again, makes it really noisy. *

AI: *Readable sans-serif base with clear headings, but hierarchy and consistency are uneven. The project tiles mix very large, heavy headlines (e.g., 'Checkout Flow Redesign' and 'OTHER PROJECTS') with very small body copy (e.g., the ATS Integration description), creating jarring scale jumps. Decorative horizontal rules vary in length and placement across tiles, weakening rhythm. Brand logos with their own typefaces sit next to the site type, adding typographic noise. Some captions appear light gray on pastel backgrounds, reducing contrast.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The composition here is really bad.
- The images are all cut off.
- You'll notice that in the Masonry grid of images, the white space around all the images is very inconsistent.
- The type size is inconsistent, and some of the images are even cut off, which is a big no-no.*

AI: *The grid of large tiles is straightforward and scannable, but internal compositions are inconsistent. Several tiles feel crowded or unbalanced: the GoodHire card crams multiple logos and a tightly cropped screenshot; the top-left and top-right tiles place imagery floating near edges with uneven padding; the 'Other Projects' section uses oversized type that overpowers the right-side phone mock and creates visual tension. Alignment of decorative lines and blocks is not consistent across cards, and vertical rhythm between sections feels uneven.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There are too many colors going on here, it's kind of a disaster.
- There's an attempt at doing a pastel color background for all the images, but because there's so many colors in the UI in the foreground, it effectively loses the effect.
- They also kept all the logos of the clients they work with really big, and because all the logos have different colors too, it just totally takes away from the intended effect of the pastel palette.
- There's also some really awkward examples of color usage at the very bottom of the page where they've used full-color social logos (which is already a lot) and on top of it, they've chosen to use a colored outline in teal, which is like tons of color that doesn't mean anything and in a place where it's probably not very important to draw attention to. *

AI: *Backgrounds switch between unrelated pastels (light blue, peach, lavender, teal) and strong brand colors, leading to a scattered palette. The large purple logo lockups and the teal 'Other Projects' band compete rather than harmonize. Several small tags and captions use low-contrast gray on light backgrounds, hurting clarity. There is no evident cohesive color system tying the tiles together.*

### 5. Candidate 7
**Overall Gap:** 1.70 (Human: 1.30, AI: 3.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is kind of a disaster:
- The DM on the top left is way too big compared to the rest of the elements in the nav bar
- There's not enough white space between the hello I'm Dorna and the content underneath it
- The description of herself is right-aligned, which is almost always a mistake*

AI: *Clear basic hierarchy (large H1, medium card titles, small descriptions) and a safe sans-serif choice keep things readable. However, the hero paragraph is center‑aligned and narrow, which hurts readability. Card body copy appears light gray and small, resulting in low contrast against white cards. Spacing between card titles and descriptions varies slightly from tile to tile, and the CTA section uses a different scale and alignment than the grid, signaling a loose type system rather than a well-defined scale.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *This is one of the word layouts I've seen. They are going for a left-right, left-right effect, but because the vertical space between the different cards is not the same as the horizontal space, it creates this awkward gap that takes away from the effectiveness of the design. 

At the bottom of the page, you'll also see a section that says "Like what you see?" I think this is supposed to fit in the left-right, left-right grid, but because there's no card around it again, it doesn't seem like that. So if they had to either add a card in the background or have that happy its own section. It was a bad choice to put it in the zigzag layout because, really, this is almost like a different concept. All that everything in the zigzag layout is a case study, whereas this is a call to action. So it probably should have been its own layout. *

AI: *Two‑column card grid with consistent gutters and generous whitespace shows control. Card containers, radii, and shadows are consistent. Weaknesses: the grid starts with the first card on the right, creating odd initial balance. Varying card heights cause a masonry effect that breaks vertical rhythm. The heavy pink Lyft tile creates a strong weight on the left lower quadrant, while the ‘Like what you see?’ CTA block competes with the adjacent card, producing imbalance. Hero content is centered while the grid aligns to a two‑column layout, so section-to-section alignment feels disjointed.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The color here is a consistent cut pastel palette on top of a generally more monochrome website design with a slight highlight. It's mostly fine. It's not a particularly well-executed pastel color palette, but it's not bad either. *

AI: *Pastel swatches (yellow, orange, purple, mint, pink) create a friendly tone and are applied consistently as image backdrops. The broad variety of hues reduces overall cohesion and adds visual noise across the grid. Some pale backgrounds (e.g., yellow under the first thumbnail) reduce contrast with white card edges, making the thumbnail feel washed out. Neutral UI (black/gray/white) is safe but body text gray is a bit too light, impacting legibility.*

### 6. Candidate 11
**Overall Gap:** 1.55 (Human: 1.80, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is not terrible in the spacing, but it has some problems in terms of typesetting. A few examples in the navbar they use this all-caps, wide letter spacing design which is usually a bad sign. 

They then use a different outline for the selected tab that makes it look like a button instead of a selected tab, which confuses two patterns. 

They also selected a font that I think doesn't really work well at large sizes. It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, "Hello, I'm Hayley" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. 

There's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.

Using an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste. If we're going to make something really important in your site, it probably shouldn't be a default emoji. *

AI: *Clean single sans-serif system with clear hierarchy (larger headline, smaller body, uppercase pill nav). The 1px-outline pill buttons and the underlined 'Let's chat' link are readable and restrained. However, body copy and footer links are set quite small relative to the headline, reducing readability and visual balance. Tracking/line-height are acceptable but not refined; the hero subtext looks tight compared to the generous whitespace. Overall competent but not typographically expressive.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is trying to be relatively minimal but it's not really working that well because:
- The navbar is super wide (takes up the whole width of the screen)
- The content of the body is very narrow
- The footer is wide again, but the footer is not as wide as the navbar
Inconsistent.

And then speaking of the footer, you'll notice that it's this very strange layout where the work section is really long and the about section is really short. This creates a lot of white space towards the right side. Work and about are top-aligned, but then the social icons are center-aligned. This inconsistency creates some ugly white space. *

AI: *Strong, orderly 3x3 square thumbnail grid with consistent gutters and alignment creates a clear focal area. The centered hero stack above the grid and the full-width light-gray footer block establish a simple, legible structure. Spacing between hero text and the grid is well-sized, giving the work room to breathe. Minor issues: the footer’s three-column content (work list, about, social icons) feels slightly unbalanced with large empty areas to the right and very small vertical rhythm in link lists.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The use of color here is fine. I think that keeping all the color in the middle is working well for her. And all the colors are sort of like a nice contrasting blue and red and various shades of it. So that's working fine.*

AI: *Neutral page chrome (white background, black text, subtle gray footer) lets the colorful thumbnails carry visual interest. The tiles themselves are vibrant and crisp, but the palette across tiles is eclectic and can read as a patchwork rather than a cohesive system. The single accent on the link is understated; overall color use is safe and functional, not highly curated.*

### 7. Candidate 13
**Overall Gap:** 1.40 (Human: 2.25, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *They used a pretty interesting serif here that I think is a sign that they have thought about this. The body also uses a relatively interesting looking model. But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. *

AI: *Strong, characterful serif H1 creates clear hierarchy and personality. However, most body copy appears set in a small monospaced/sans style with tight line-height, which hurts readability and feels visually cramped (e.g., the small paragraph under the hero and the lists under UNDERSTAND/ITERATE/REFINE). All‑caps micro‑headings and very small top-right nav further reduce legibility. Link lists show dense underlined teal text with uneven rag and tight bullet spacing, suggesting weaker micro‑typography control.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.

So, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The "See my work" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. *

AI: *Clean, consistent 3‑column grid with even gutters; the illustrated tiles align well and establish rhythm. Generous white space around the hero and the CTA helps focus. Hierarchy from large centered headline to three process columns is clear. Minor composition issues: brand name left-aligned while the hero is centered creates a slight imbalance at the top; vertical spacing within each column (between subhead, paragraph, and link list) feels a bit tight compared to the airy hero.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *They chose a pretty interesting pair of colors for the green and the yellow. I think it's actually quite good because of their complementarity*

AI: *Cohesive palette of deep teal, warm beige, and neutrals. Teal is used consistently for brand, links, and CTA outline; beige backgrounds in illustrations add warmth and unify the set. Contrast is generally solid, though the pale beige against white is subtle and some teal underlined link clusters create visual noise. Overall, disciplined and tasteful color usage.*

### 8. Candidate 4
**Overall Gap:** 1.35 (Human: 2.65, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The type usage here is medium to maybe slightly below average. I'm between an average to below average here, and so the main issue I have is that it's using a few too many styles, right? For example, I see a serif font that is large and I see a medium size. I see a small size. I see three sizes. I also see two different weights. I see italics too. And then there's a color change in the typography too. It's really using every single style in the book without necessarily thinking too hard about how necessary that is. You probably could've achieved a lot of the same effects with a lot less typography styles, so that it's a little less messy.*

AI: *Refined serif system with clear hierarchy: company/title set larger, dates in italic, and body copy with generous leading creates a calm reading rhythm. The serif/sans pairing is restrained (script wordmark, serif content) and mostly cohesive. However, the opening intro paragraph runs very long (wide measure ~90–100 characters) which reduces readability, and the pill CTAs use small text with a very light stroke that feels delicate/under-weight compared to surrounding copy. Minor inconsistencies in emphasis between company names and roles keep it from feeling impeccable.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *Layout here is okay, it's not that great, it's not terrible. The main problem here is the navbar and the footer. Let me explain. The navbar is really wide. And the signature of the person in their name, Cecile Parker, at the top is a little too big for the rest of the composition. The footer is actually a little too narrow and is insufficiently separated from the body with white space. The body, the content itself is pretty decent, the layout has enough white space to create hierarchy. And things look decently well organized. *

AI: *Clean two-column grid: employer/role on the left with dates aligned to the right column and descriptions consistently aligned below; strong use of negative space and even vertical rhythm between sections. Visual anchors (left column labels, right-aligned dates, CTA) are generally consistent. Small issues: the oversized intro block crowds the top and visually outweighs the nav; the script name floats slightly off the main grid; varying paragraph lengths produce uneven white-space blocks and occasional awkward gaps before the "View work" buttons.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There really isn't enough to tell too much about the color here. I think generally it's OK, but this is a low confidence OK. *

AI: *Minimal monochrome palette with tasteful, sparing accent (subtle gold/orange for the email line and muted social icons). High contrast between body text and background ensures readability. The outline buttons use a very light gray stroke that feels a bit faint next to the strong black text, slightly weakening emphasis and affordance. Overall tasteful, restrained color use but not pushing craft to a standout level.*

### 9. Candidate 14
**Overall Gap:** 1.35 (Human: 4.70, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Clean, readable serif body copy gives an editorial feel and pairs with a small sans-serif for section labels. However, hierarchy is muted: section labels (“About”, “Notes”, etc.) are very small and low-contrast, competing with body text rather than leading it. Post titles are only slightly bolder/larger than excerpts, so scanability suffers. Micro-typography has some inconsistencies: the caption under the hero image sits tightly against the photo, and date treatments differ visually (e.g., condensed 'Fri, 28 Mar' versus stacked numeric dates in Posts), breaking rhythm.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *A disciplined two-column grid (narrow left label column, content on the right) provides strong alignment and a predictable rhythm down the page. Spacing between major sections is consistent and the photo thumbnails sit on an even grid with equal gutters. Minor issues: the initial text block feels dense with limited breathing room above the hero image, and the contact section’s right column becomes ragged due to uneven line lengths, slightly weakening the grid tightness.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *A restrained grayscale palette keeps focus on content and imagery, which is cohesive and not noisy. That said, the color system is minimal to a fault: link accents are very subtle and section labels are light gray, bordering on low contrast. The single large photo introduces color but there’s no deliberate accent color strategy to build hierarchy or states.*

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clear hierarchy with a large bold H1 and smaller supporting copy. The marker-style yellow highlights add emphasis and personality. However, body text is quite small with long line length, reducing readability, and contrast is low (light gray on a warm off‑white background). Testimonial cards use dense, small text with minimal leading, and CTAs are tiny, making the type scale feel inconsistent across sections.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Overall flow is conventional and understandable: hero, selected work cards, testimonials, and a logo row. Spacing is generally generous, but there are inconsistencies: the second project card appears partially washed out/cropped with a large white gradient overlapping devices; the third project preview is clipped at the fold; testimonial cards have uneven heights leading to a ragged baseline; and device mockups are rotated/heavy with shadows that create visual clutter. These issues weaken alignment and rhythm.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Cohesive palette of warm off‑white, soft beige section, and subtle pastel card tints. The lemon‑yellow highlight is a clear, consistent accent used in headings and callouts. Grayscale treatment of logos keeps them subdued. Minor drawbacks are occasional low contrast in body copy and very light buttons that can feel faint against light backgrounds.*

## Common AI Blindspots

**Excess Blindness:**
- Occurred in 1 candidates: 4

**Sloppiness Blindness:**
- Occurred in 5 candidates: 11, 13, 31, 25

**Inconsistency Blindness:**
- Occurred in 3 candidates: 11, 29, 26

## Recommendations for Prompt Improvement

1. **Add explicit inconsistency detection:**
   - AI is missing width/alignment inconsistencies between sections
   - Add specific guidance about checking cross-section consistency

3. **Define 'sloppy' indicators:**
   - AI sees 'clean' where humans see 'sloppy'
   - List specific sloppy indicators: misaligned elements, inconsistent spacing, etc.
