## Top 10 Candidates with Largest Gaps

### 1. Candidate 26
**Overall Gap:** 2.15 (Human: 0.55, AI: 2.70)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is really bad. The navbar name is way too big, right? Like Melanie Cernak is huge compared to the rest of the site. It probably is not the most important thing on this page. And also it's in awkward all caps and a font that doesn't look very good all capped. 

And then the images - all the text is different sizes and different. Some of them even don't have a body, whereas others have a body and a title. They also kept the logos of the people that they work with really big, and every logo is a different type. Again, makes it really noisy. *

AI: *Legibility is fine, but the typographic system feels inconsistent across tiles. The centered intro line ('Check out my work:') is set in a small, default-looking style that clashes with the oversized, bold headings used in the project cards. Uppercased sublabels (e.g., 'LEADING THROUGH DESIGN', 'PRODUCT STRATEGY') are letter‑spaced and visually heavy compared to adjacent body copy. The 'Checkout Flow Redesign' headline is very large with loose leading, overwhelming the rest of the card. Overall hierarchy works within each tile but lacks a cohesive scale and rhythm across the page.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The composition here is really bad.
- The images are all cut off.
- You'll notice that in the Masonry grid of images, the white space around all the images is very inconsistent.
- The type size is inconsistent, and some of the images are even cut off, which is a big no-no.*

AI: *A clear card grid is present, but spacing and balance vary tile to tile. The large Tophatter tile breaks the vertical rhythm and the phone mockup hugs the right edge, creating tension. Some tiles have generous padding while others feel tight (e.g., GoodHire/JazzHR screenshot sits close to edges). The 'OTHER PROJECTS' section uses oversized type that is cropped, introducing a visual jump and crowding against the right-side UI mock. Mixed alignments (centered intro, then left-aligned grid) disrupt flow.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There are too many colors going on here, it's kind of a disaster.
- There's an attempt at doing a pastel color background for all the images, but because there's so many colors in the UI in the foreground, it effectively loses the effect.
- They also kept all the logos of the clients they work with really big, and because all the logos have different colors too, it just totally takes away from the intended effect of the pastel palette.
- There's also some really awkward examples of color usage at the very bottom of the page where they've used full-color social logos (which is already a lot) and on top of it, they've chosen to use a colored outline in teal, which is like tons of color that doesn't mean anything and in a place where it's probably not very important to draw attention to. *

AI: *Each card uses its own pastel background (pale blue, pink, mint) combined with bold brand colors, producing a patchwork rather than a cohesive palette. The heavy purple in the Tophatter tile collides with the muted pastels, and the gray 'Social change' tags on light backgrounds read low-contrast. The turquoise social icons at the footer introduce yet another hue not integrated elsewhere. Color feels functional but not curated into a unified system.*

### 2. Candidate 7
**Overall Gap:** 2.05 (Human: 1.30, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is kind of a disaster:
- The DM on the top left is way too big compared to the rest of the elements in the nav bar
- There's not enough white space between the hello I'm Dorna and the content underneath it
- The description of herself is right-aligned, which is almost always a mistake*

AI: *Consistent use of a modern sans-serif throughout with clear hierarchy (large H1, card titles, small descriptions). However, several elements feel under-scaled and light: the top navigation and card descriptions appear around 12–13px with light gray color, reducing legibility against the white cards; the small pill 'coming soon' note uses a pale yellow icon on white, creating low contrast. Letter spacing and leading are acceptable but not finely tuned—hero body copy is slightly tight while card descriptions feel a touch cramped. Overall clean but not refined enough to feel premium.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *This is one of the word layouts I've seen. They are going for a left-right, left-right effect, but because the vertical space between the different cards is not the same as the horizontal space, it creates this awkward gap that takes away from the effectiveness of the design. 

At the bottom of the page, you'll also see a section that says "Like what you see?" I think this is supposed to fit in the left-right, left-right grid, but because there's no card around it again, it doesn't seem like that. So if they had to either add a card in the background or have that happy its own section. It was a bad choice to put it in the zigzag layout because, really, this is almost like a different concept. All that everything in the zigzag layout is a case study, whereas this is a call to action. So it probably should have been its own layout. *

AI: *A tidy two‑column card grid with consistent gutters, generous margins, and ample white space. Cards have uniform padding, subtle elevation via soft shadows, and consistent corner radii. The colored backplates behind screenshots add depth and a clear focal hierarchy without clutter. Minor issues: masonry staggering leads to uneven baselines across rows, and a few thumbnail/backplate placements feel slightly off-center, creating small balance inconsistencies. Still, overall structure is orderly and visually coherent.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The color here is a consistent cut pastel palette on top of a generally more monochrome website design with a slight highlight. It's mostly fine. It's not a particularly well-executed pastel color palette, but it's not bad either. *

AI: *Pastel backplates (yellow, orange, lavender, mint, teal, salmon) create a friendly tone and help differentiate projects. Yet the palette feels somewhat arbitrary rather than systemized—adjacent cards sometimes clash in temperature/saturation, and some pairings fight with the screenshot colors (e.g., bright warm backplate behind a dark, cool screenshot). Core UI uses safe grayscale with dark buttons, which is dependable but not particularly expressive. Contrast for text on white cards is fine; small status elements trend too low contrast.*

### 3. Candidate 29
**Overall Gap:** 2.00 (Human: 1.35, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *This is an example of minimalist typography done poorly. Right off the bat, they don't consistently capitalize their sentences. They do it in some places but not others. 

They use emojis instead of bullet points which creates noise and adds a weird indent on the left. Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. 

There's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. 

Then there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. 

They also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason. And then the button outline also doesn't match the stroke width of the text inside the button or frankly anything else on the page. *

AI: *Clean sans-serif system with clear hierarchy between large project titles and smaller metadata. Good use of weight and letterspacing for the small uppercase category labels. However, the hero paragraph runs very long with dense line length, reducing readability. The small all-caps 'VIEW' pill is overly tiny with tight tracking, which weakens scannability. Body copy under each project appears slightly light with modest contrast compared to headings. Overall competent but not exquisitely tuned.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is another one of those examples of just different for every section.
- The navbar is super wide
- It narrows down into the hero section (which is fine)
- It broadens a little wider again in the body where there's like case studies
I think that the hero and the case study section are technically the same width, but because the text on the hero doesn't run all the way to the right, it feels like it's not the same width. This creates this very awkward and inconsistent right rag.*

AI: *Consistent two-column rhythm: thumbnail on the left, text on the right, repeated with even gutters and generous white space. Project cards are well-aligned; image crops are clean with consistent padding and proportions. The 'Additional Work' section uses a balanced two-up grid with matching image sizes and tidy captions. Minor knocks: the tiny CTA pills get lost in the hierarchy, and the abrupt full-bleed blue footer shifts the visual balance at the end.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There is sort of like an attempt here at doing sort of like an electric blue driven theme here, but because the case studies are also that backgrounds are sort of completely different colors and then they are very loud.

We're seeing gradients, we're seeing orange, we're seeing very dark blacks. It just takes away from the overall power of the monochrome plus electric blue color palettes. *

AI: *Neutral base (white/black) with a bright electric blue accent keeps things crisp. Individual project tiles introduce varied background colors (light blue, dark navy, purple gradient, peach), which adds interest but feels somewhat unsystematic and slightly disjointed across the page. The saturated full-width blue footer is visually heavy compared to the otherwise minimal page. Contrast is sufficient throughout, but palette cohesion could be stronger.*

### 4. Candidate 37
**Overall Gap:** 1.95 (Human: 1.70, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Strong sans‑serif system with clear scale and hierarchy. The hero headline shows confident type sizing and weight contrast; key phrases are emphasized effectively and the overall line length is comfortable. Section headers like “I worked on…” and “What it’s like working with me” are consistently styled and easy to scan. Minor issues: multiple bold switches within a single sentence plus yellow marker accents create a slightly busy reading rhythm; testimonial body copy is small and light grey on a warm background, reducing contrast; button labels are slightly under-sized relative to surrounding text.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clean, modern card-based layout with ample negative space and consistent rounded corners/shadow treatments. Project tiles sit on a clear grid with generous padding. However, several compositional issues bring it to average: the hero adds visual noise (confetti pattern, star doodle, marker highlights) that competes with the headline; the second project card shows a faded overlay and angled device breaking alignment; vertical rhythm is uneven with a large gap before the third project tile; testimonial cards vary in density and create a slightly cluttered block; the bottom ‘companies’ row mixes logo sizes and colors, reducing visual cohesion.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Pleasant, restrained palette: warm off‑white background with black typography and a consistent yellow accent (marker highlights and small arrow) creates a recognizable identity. Subtle pastel backdrops on project cards add depth without overwhelming. Contrast on headings and CTAs is good. Weak spots: the confetti dots introduce an extra purple tone that feels decorative rather than purposeful, and some body text in grey on the warm background lowers readability slightly.*

### 5. Candidate 54
**Overall Gap:** 1.85 (Human: 2.15, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Consistent sans-serif system with clear hierarchy: a bold hero heading balanced against smaller supporting copy; navigation and captions are restrained and coherent. Line spacing and alignment feel deliberate, and the left-aligned hero block is readable. Minor issues prevent a top score: supporting paragraph and project captions use very light gray on dark/white backgrounds respectively, reducing contrast; captions are quite small relative to image size, making metadata feel faint; overall scale could push bolder typographic rhythm.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout here is another example of really strange horizontal sizing between every section. So navbar and then the case studies are the same width, but then the hero section is super wide. *

AI: *Strong composition overall. The hero uses an effective asymmetrical layout—text block on the left, animated grid motif on the right—creating balance with ample negative space. The work section employs a clean two-column grid with generous gutters and consistent caption placement, producing a calm rhythm. Some uneven vertical rhythm arises from variable thumbnail heights and different mockup treatments (flat screenshots vs. device frames), which slightly breaks consistency and polish.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The color here is a fine like just all monochrome. In fact, it's a little too monochrome. *

AI: *Controlled, tasteful palette: deep charcoal hero with off-white type sets a sophisticated tone; the content area switches to white, allowing thumbnails to pop. Shadows and gray panels are used sparingly to separate elements. Slight drawbacks: low-contrast gray body/caption text and occasional muted-on-muted pairings in the hero reduce clarity; thumbnail colors aren’t curated to a single palette, creating mild visual noise.*

### 6. Candidate 11
**Overall Gap:** 1.85 (Human: 1.80, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is not terrible in the spacing, but it has some problems in terms of typesetting. A few examples in the navbar they use this all-caps, wide letter spacing design which is usually a bad sign. 

They then use a different outline for the selected tab that makes it look like a button instead of a selected tab, which confuses two patterns. 

They also selected a font that I think doesn't really work well at large sizes. It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, "Hello, I'm Hayley" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. 

There's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.

Using an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste. If we're going to make something really important in your site, it probably shouldn't be a default emoji. *

AI: *Clean single-sans setup with clear hierarchy (bold centered headline, lighter subhead) keeps things readable. However, scale and rhythm are fairly basic: the subhead and body links appear small with tight leading, especially in the gray footer where link lists look cramped and lack comfortable line-height. Inconsistent treatments in the top nav (outlined 'Work' pill next to plain text links) and an underlined teal inline link in the hero introduce stylistic inconsistency. Overall competent but not refined or expressive.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is trying to be relatively minimal but it's not really working that well because:
- The navbar is super wide (takes up the whole width of the screen)
- The content of the body is very narrow
- The footer is wide again, but the footer is not as wide as the navbar
Inconsistent.

And then speaking of the footer, you'll notice that it's this very strange layout where the work section is really long and the about section is really short. This creates a lot of white space towards the right side. Work and about are top-aligned, but then the social icons are center-aligned. This inconsistency creates some ugly white space. *

AI: *The 3x3 thumbnail grid is well-executed: consistent square crops, equal gutters, and strong alignment create a crisp gallery. Generous white space around the grid focuses attention. The hero is succinct and centered. Minor compositional issues: the header bar feels unbalanced (left-aligned monogram vs right-aligned nav with empty center), and the gray footer’s two-column lists and right-aligned social/copyright lack baseline alignment and visual cohesion with the main grid width. Despite those, the overall structure is orderly and scannable.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The use of color here is fine. I think that keeping all the color in the middle is working well for her. And all the colors are sort of like a nice contrasting blue and red and various shades of it. So that's working fine.*

AI: *Neutral page chrome (white with light gray footer) lets the vibrant, high-saturation thumbnails create an engaging visual mosaic. The color variety is lively yet not chaotic due to consistent tile sizing. Small mismatches keep it from top-tier: the heavy black outline style on the 'Work' button feels disconnected from the otherwise light chrome, and the teal inline link in the hero reads as a one-off accent rather than part of a cohesive palette.*

### 7. Candidate 25
**Overall Gap:** 1.65 (Human: 1.70, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *Typography here is sloppy. So you'll notice that they use all caps for the items in the nav bar where it's not necessary. You also notice that all the headers are sort of like different styles, so their name Matt is a different weight and size than the headers in their images (the AI data assistant). Even though they are very similar, and then the "Open to chat" is also a different style. They just seem very similar but also different, which adds visual noise. *

AI: *Clear sans-serif system with sensible hierarchy (large H1 for the name, bold project titles on tiles, small nav). Line spacing is comfortable and titles align consistently across project tiles. However, the hero paragraph is quite wide (roughly 80–90+ characters per line), reducing readability and polish. Mixed emphasis styles appear in the footer CTA (all-caps button label with thin border vs. body copy), and the tiny social icons/text under the hero feel visually underweighted compared to the headline.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The composition here is mostly awkward from the sloppy images. The image is just like there's no consistency in how they're laid out. *

AI: *Strong grid and rhythm: generous margins, consistent left-aligned titles, and repeatable project-card structure create clarity. Thumbnails are framed cleanly and generally high-resolution. Negative space between sections is even, producing a steady scroll. Minor issues: decorative curved shapes in the top-right of some tiles introduce uneven tension against the container edge; right-side mockups vary in scale and vertical anchoring across tiles, which slightly breaks consistency; the full-width light-gray CTA band disrupts the otherwise contained card rhythm.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The colors here almost have a system, but not quite. The first two images have a multi-colored background that is in the same hue. It's not super but it's working-ish. But then they do something completely different in the third and fourth images where it's just a solid pastel background. They also use a laptop picture for the third image, which is a bit more realistic, but doesn't really work well with their more UI-driven stuff for the first, second, and fourth images. *

AI: *Pleasant, contemporary backgrounds (teal, lavender, light gray) with occasional gradients feel approachable. Yet the palette lacks a cohesive system across the full page—the bright yellow project tile is far more saturated than the cooler pastels above it, creating a jump in visual weight. Accent blues/purples in the decorative shapes compete with the mockups on some tiles. Overall safe and serviceable, but not tightly harmonized.*

### 8. Candidate 52
**Overall Gap:** 1.65 (Human: 2.00, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *The site relies on a single geometric sans with heavy tracking in the hero (all‑caps 'TAYLOR CHE'). The extreme letter‑spacing creates awkward optical gaps (e.g., between Y–L and H–E) and feels a bit crude at this scale. Body/caption styles under project thumbnails are small and light, giving weak hierarchy relative to titles; the project label (e.g., 'Sunflower', 'Xbox', 'UCLA Library') is barely distinguished from the one‑line description. Navigation text is tiny and loses presence compared to the oversized hero. Overall legible but not a refined typographic system.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *A clean, centered single‑column grid with generous white space produces a clear reading flow. Project thumbnails are sized consistently and aligned, and captions line up neatly below each image. The collage framing (tape, paper edges) is applied consistently across projects and does not break alignment. Minor issues: the patterned divider below the hero introduces visual noise and interrupts vertical rhythm; the footer two‑column block ('Let's chat!' vs 'Contact') feels a bit under‑weighted and loose compared to the strong hero, creating an imbalanced start/finish.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *A distinctive palette of deep maroon, muted greens, and warm neutrals gives personality while maintaining adequate contrast (white text on maroon is crisp). The project collages use coordinated earthy tones that tie together. However, the combination of dark maroon plus saturated olive pattern can edge toward heaviness, and multiple textures/patterns within the same viewport slightly clutter the visual calm.*

### 9. Candidate 31
**Overall Gap:** 1.50 (Human: 1.30, AI: 2.80)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is kind of a disaster. If you just look at the header section, everything is almost too bold, she's using bold for everything. From Hey Natalia to Bridging the Gap to Product Designer, all of these are bold. When everything is bold, nothing is bold. 

If you look at the navbar, you see that there's a classic example of super-wide letter space, all-caps design in the word Product Designer. This is another classic rookie mistake in typesetting. 

Another example of a rookie mistake is if you go to her project section. There is a pattern where she uses a vertical divider line between every label for the case studies that she did, but the vertical line is way taller and also very dark, which instead makes the vertical line seem like it grabs too much attention. This is a common pattern of failure. 

Another bad pattern here is if you look at the bottom where in her About Me section she has tons of random bolding in her paragraph text. It's like almost feels like every fifth word here is bolded. And then if you look at the bulleted list inside the body of the text, the bulleted list has too much left-side indent. 

And then she randomly switches from left-align text to center-align text when it comes to her email. *

AI: *Clear sans-serif system with sensible hierarchy, but execution is only average. The hero H1 is strong, yet body text elsewhere (especially the dense about section at the bottom) is too small with long line lengths, hurting readability. Eyebrow labels like “Portfolio” are set in very small caps with tight letter‑spacing, which looks fussy. Headline casing is inconsistent across cards (e.g., “Seamless Onboarding experience” vs “Data Management infrastructure”), signaling loose typographic rules. The stats row mixes numeral treatments (e.g., 5y+, 10y+) and alignment, weakening polish.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout in the beginning couplet section is not great, but it's not terrible. But then when you go into the "My skills" and "About me" section, it's really terrible, right? So if you look at the indent right after the title. There's a huge amount of white space. We're thinking that the things under the title start a little bit more to the right for no reason. It doesn't align with anything. And then there's this really strange triangular text pattern that serves no purpose In the skill section.*

AI: *Overall structure is coherent with alternating light/dark bands and left‑text/right‑image modules, but composition lacks refinement. Case study blocks vary in screenshot scale and aren’t aligned to a consistent grid; the dark band’s mockup sits at a different vertical position than the adjacent light sections. The clients/stats row feels under‑grouped and floats with excessive whitespace. The four‑column 'I am a designer who is' section reads unevenly—icons and text blocks don’t share consistent spacing and vertical rhythm, creating a wobbly grid. The faint background word behind the portrait adds mild visual noise.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There is a consistent attempt to add a color palette between shades of grey and then this blue-green thing. It's not bad, it's not done very well, but it's okay, I guess. *

AI: *Restrained palette of white/black with a teal accent is cohesive and professional. Alternating dark sections provide clear contrast and scanning rhythm. Accent color is applied consistently to links, icons, and CTAs. Minor issue: outline buttons on dark backgrounds have low visual weight, reducing affordance slightly. Overall, tasteful and controlled.*

### 10. Candidate 35
**Overall Gap:** 1.35 (Human: 4.70, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *Typography here is really strong. They use a very subtle serif to emphasize certain things while keeping things in line. It's usually pretty hard to combine both serif and sans-serif in line, and they've done it well. There's also really good use of white space to create hierarchy here. *

AI: *Careful, restrained type treatment. Strong hierarchy through italic intro line and subtle section headings (e.g., Building / Projects / Writing). Consistent line spacing and clean link styling with small ↗ icons shows attention to micro‑typography. Columns use the same type scale, keeping rhythm tight. Deductions: body copy appears quite small with relatively light gray, reducing contrast; the 'Now' section has a long measure, which hurts readability and weakens hierarchy at a distance.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The layout is effective and simple. They also switch from a single column to three columns in the middle, which works quite well because it keeps the same width throughout. *

AI: *Minimal asymmetric layout with generous negative space and a tidy three‑column block that shares consistent gutters. Section spacing is even from top to bottom and the footer elements align neatly. However, the page lacks a strong focal point; large empty right side creates visual imbalance. The three columns feel narrow relative to the canvas, and the long single-column paragraphs below don’t leverage the grid to guide the eye, making the composition feel underpowered.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *It's all monochrome, but it's working quite well because of the subtle color choices. There is a restraint and balance in the use of different shades of gray here. *

AI: *Monochrome palette with subtle gray hierarchy and a restrained accent for links. The neutrality feels intentional and clean. Still, contrast on some gray text is borderline and the palette doesn’t demonstrate broader color craft or nuanced tonal layering beyond grayscale.*

## Common AI Blindspots

**Sloppiness Blindness:**
- Occurred in 3 candidates: 11, 13, 25

**Inconsistency Blindness:**
- Occurred in 2 candidates: 11, 29

## Recommendations for Prompt Improvement

1. **Add explicit inconsistency detection:**
   - AI is missing width/alignment inconsistencies between sections
   - Add specific guidance about checking cross-section consistency

3. **Define 'sloppy' indicators:**
   - AI sees 'clean' where humans see 'sloppy'
   - List specific sloppy indicators: misaligned elements, inconsistent spacing, etc.
