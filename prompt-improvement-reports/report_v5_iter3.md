## Top 10 Candidates with Largest Gaps

### 1. Candidate 29
**Overall Gap:** 2.65 (Human: 1.35, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *This is an example of minimalist typography done poorly. Right off the bat, they don't consistently capitalize their sentences. They do it in some places but not others. 

They use emojis instead of bullet points which creates noise and adds a weird indent on the left. Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. 

There's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. 

Then there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. 

They also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason. And then the button outline also doesn't match the stroke width of the text inside the button or frankly anything else on the page. *

AI: *Clean, modern sans-serif system with a clear type scale. The hero paragraph uses strong weight and tight tracking to create emphasis while remaining readable. Small uppercase section labels (e.g., CASE STUDIES, ADDITIONAL WORK) with letterspacing provide crisp hierarchy. Project titles are bold and clearly separated from category labels in lighter gray, building contrast. Microcopy like the pill 'VIEW' buttons is consistent. Minor nits: the hero line length is slightly long, and thereâ€™s occasional mismatch in capitalization styles across elements (title case vs sentence case), which softens polish.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is another one of those examples of just different for every section.
- The navbar is super wide
- It narrows down into the hero section (which is fine)
- It broadens a little wider again in the body where there's like case studies
I think that the hero and the case study section are technically the same width, but because the text on the hero doesn't run all the way to the right, it feels like it's not the same width. This creates this very awkward and inconsistent right rag.*

AI: *Consistent two-column rhythm with generous whitespace and strong left alignment keeps the page scannable. Thumbnails align nicely to a grid with uniform rounded corners and spacing; the two-up 'Additional Work' grid is balanced and maintains equal gutters. Clear vertical rhythm between image, title, meta line, and CTA. Minor issues: the centered 'CASE STUDIES' label breaks alignment with the left-aligned content below; repeating image-left/text-right cards can feel monotonous; some CTAs don't baseline-align across cards, slightly reducing harmony.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There is sort of like an attempt here at doing sort of like an electric blue driven theme here, but because the case studies are also that backgrounds are sort of completely different colors and then they are very loud.

We're seeing gradients, we're seeing orange, we're seeing very dark blacks. It just takes away from the overall power of the monochrome plus electric blue color palettes. *

AI: *Neutral black/white base with a confident electric blue accent used for links and the full-bleed footer gives a distinct personality. Project thumbnails use varied but controlled pastel backgrounds (light blue, peach) and a darker panel, creating visual interest without clashing. Contrast is strong throughout (black text on white, white on blue in the footer). Small quibble: the footer blue is very saturated and visually heavy compared to the otherwise airy page; one dark thumbnail is notably heavier than others, slightly disrupting tonal consistency.*

### 2. Candidate 52
**Overall Gap:** 2.00 (Human: 2.00, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Strong, confident type in the hero (large uppercase sans with generous tracking) creates clear hierarchy and presence. Navigation uses a restrained, small-caps style that aligns with the minimal aesthetic. Body captions under projects are consistently styled and aligned. However, project labels and descriptions are quite small relative to the card images, which hurts readability and hierarchy at a glance. Minor inconsistencies in tracking/case between sections (hero vs. captions) keep it from feeling systematized enough for a 5.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clean single-column grid with ample negative space. Case study tiles maintain consistent width and vertical rhythm, and the footer is neatly split into two columns aligned to the same grid. The textured, collage-style project frames are thoughtfully composed and add personality without breaking alignment. Small issues: the decorative cat-pattern divider is visually heavy and slightly distracts from the hero-to-content transition; some collage elements (tape, torn edges) introduce minor visual noise that reduces overall crispness.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *A cohesive, muted palette of maroon, olive, and paper textures gives a distinctive identity. White type on maroon provides strong contrast. Project backgrounds use harmonious earthy tones that keep screens from feeling sterile. Slight clashes occur where the olive cat-pattern band meets the deep maroon hero, and color cues are more decorative than systematic, preventing a more refined, scalable scheme worthy of a 5.*

### 3. Candidate 25
**Overall Gap:** 1.95 (Human: 1.70, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *Typography here is sloppy. So you'll notice that they use all caps for the items in the nav bar where it's not necessary. You also notice that all the headers are sort of like different styles, so their name Matt is a different weight and size than the headers in their images (the AI data assistant). Even though they are very similar, and then the "Open to chat" is also a different style. They just seem very similar but also different, which adds visual noise. *

AI: *Consistent single sans-serif family with clear hierarchy between H1, project titles, and small labels. Project titles inside the colored tiles are strong and legible. However, the typographic system feels basic: only one weight contrast is used, resulting in a somewhat flat rhythm. The hero paragraph has a long measure and modest line height that reads a bit dense. Small secondary labels under project titles appear light and low-contrast on tinted backgrounds, reducing clarity. The CTA button copy in the footer sits slightly tight within its pill, suggesting imprecise vertical padding.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The composition here is mostly awkward from the sloppy images. The image is just like there's no consistency in how they're laid out. *

AI: *Clean, repeatable card system with strong left alignment and ample negative space. Each project tile uses a balanced split: large title block on the left and a mockup cluster on the right, producing a stable rhythm as you scroll. Mockups are crisp and cropped thoughtfully; the curved color shapes add directional flow without overcrowding. Spacing between tiles and sections is mostly consistent, though the grey CTA band introduces a larger vertical gap that slightly disrupts cadence. Overall composition feels intentional and tidy.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The colors here almost have a system, but not quite. The first two images have a multi-colored background that is in the same hue. It's not super but it's working-ish. But then they do something completely different in the third and fourth images where it's just a solid pastel background. They also use a laptop picture for the third image, which is a bit more realistic, but doesn't really work well with their more UI-driven stuff for the first, second, and fourth images. *

AI: *Cohesive palette of soft pastels (teal, lavender, light gray) paired with deeper blues and a saturated yellow for variety. Text contrast on the lighter panels is strong, and the backgrounds give each project a distinct visual identity while remaining harmonious. The deepest blue accent in some tiles is heavy compared to the rest of the palette, and the bright yellow section is more intense than others, creating a small imbalance across the page. Still, overall color usage is confident and visually appealing.*

### 4. Candidate 7
**Overall Gap:** 1.70 (Human: 1.30, AI: 3.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is kind of a disaster:
- The DM on the top left is way too big compared to the rest of the elements in the nav bar
- There's not enough white space between the hello I'm Dorna and the content underneath it
- The description of herself is right-aligned, which is almost always a mistake*

AI: *Clean single sans-serif family with clear hierarchy (large H1, medium card titles, small descriptions). Spacing and line length on cards are generally comfortable. However, several issues hold it back: body copy uses a light gray that reduces contrast and readability on white; the hero paragraph is center-aligned and slightly tight, which hurts scanability; button labels in heavy weight within solid black pills feel visually louder than the rest of the type system, breaking rhythm.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *This is one of the word layouts I've seen. They are going for a left-right, left-right effect, but because the vertical space between the different cards is not the same as the horizontal space, it creates this awkward gap that takes away from the effectiveness of the design. 

At the bottom of the page, you'll also see a section that says "Like what you see?" I think this is supposed to fit in the left-right, left-right grid, but because there's no card around it again, it doesn't seem like that. So if they had to either add a card in the background or have that happy its own section. It was a bad choice to put it in the zigzag layout because, really, this is almost like a different concept. All that everything in the zigzag layout is a case study, whereas this is a call to action. So it probably should have been its own layout. *

AI: *Twoâ€‘column card grid with generous white space and consistent gutters shows basic layout control. Cards have tidy internal padding and consistent corner radii. Yet the composition suffers from uneven rhythm: thumbnail aspect ratios and colored back-plates vary in size, causing misaligned eye-lines across rows; shadows/elevation are overused and feel dated; the bottom CTA section has a light headline paired with two heavy black buttons that dominate the area and create a weight imbalance. Overall balanced but not refined.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The color here is a consistent cut pastel palette on top of a generally more monochrome website design with a slight highlight. It's mostly fine. It's not a particularly well-executed pastel color palette, but it's not bad either. *

AI: *A soft pastel palette (yellows, oranges, lavenders, mints, pinks) provides a friendly tone and enough separation between cards. However, the colors appear arbitrary per card rather than part of a coherent system, leading to visual noise. The very dark black buttons clash with the otherwise muted palette, and the light gray body text lowers contrast. Color is pleasant but lacks discipline.*

### 5. Candidate 26
**Overall Gap:** 1.45 (Human: 0.55, AI: 2.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The typography here is really bad. The navbar name is way too big, right? Like Melanie Cernak is huge compared to the rest of the site. It probably is not the most important thing on this page. And also it's in awkward all caps and a font that doesn't look very good all capped. 

And then the images - all the text is different sizes and different. Some of them even don't have a body, whereas others have a body and a title. They also kept the logos of the people that they work with really big, and every logo is a different type. Again, makes it really noisy. *

AI: *Typography feels inconsistent and underâ€‘systematized. The intro line is very small relative to the oversized project headlines, creating weak hierarchy. Project cards use different scales and weights; some use thin hairline dividers and small captions while others use very large display type. The oversized 'OTHER PROJECTS' heading appears cropped and overly tight, suggesting poor attention to line height and spacing. Overall it reads like separate posters rather than a cohesive type system.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The composition here is really bad.
- The images are all cut off.
- You'll notice that in the Masonry grid of images, the white space around all the images is very inconsistent.
- The type size is inconsistent, and some of the images are even cut off, which is a big no-no.*

AI: *The page uses a mosaic of cards with uneven gutters and paddings between rows. Baselines and left edges do not line up across the twoâ€‘column rows, and the fullâ€‘bleed hero tile with a device mockup on the right feels unbalanced, with the mockup hugging the edge. The large 'OTHER PROJECTS' section collides visually with adjacent elements and looks cropped at the top. These choices create a choppy rhythm and weaken overall composition.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There are too many colors going on here, it's kind of a disaster.
- There's an attempt at doing a pastel color background for all the images, but because there's so many colors in the UI in the foreground, it effectively loses the effect.
- They also kept all the logos of the clients they work with really big, and because all the logos have different colors too, it just totally takes away from the intended effect of the pastel palette.
- There's also some really awkward examples of color usage at the very bottom of the page where they've used full-color social logos (which is already a lot) and on top of it, they've chosen to use a colored outline in teal, which is like tons of color that doesn't mean anything and in a place where it's probably not very important to draw attention to. *

AI: *Multiple pastel background blocks are mixed with bright accent colors from various graphics, resulting in a patchwork rather than a cohesive palette. Some text sits on very light pastel backgrounds with light gray type, producing low contrast. There is no clear primary/accent system tying the sections together.*

### 6. Candidate 13
**Overall Gap:** 1.40 (Human: 2.25, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *They used a pretty interesting serif here that I think is a sign that they have thought about this. The body also uses a relatively interesting looking model. But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. *

AI: *Strong hero headline in a bold serif sets a distinctive voice and clear hierarchy. However, the supporting copy uses very small mono/sans text with tight line-height, which reduces readability. The site appears to mix at least three styles (serif for hero and name, monospaced/sans for body, uppercase sans for navigation), creating a slightly fragmented system. Link lists with teal underlines visually compete with subheads, and the body copy's gray tone looks a bit light against white.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.

So, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The "See my work" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. *

AI: *Clean, balanced composition with a clear threeâ€‘column grid under the hero. Even gutters between the illustrated cards, consistent card sizing, and ample white space create a tidy rhythm. The top-left name and right-aligned nav are well balanced. Minor issues: the centered hero heading doesnâ€™t align to the leftâ€‘aligned content below, and the dense bullet lists make the lower halves of columns feel heavy compared to the upper imagery.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *They chose a pretty interesting pair of colors for the green and the yellow. I think it's actually quite good because of their complementarity*

AI: *Cohesive palette of deep teal, warm beige, and cream ties the illustrations, links, and CTA together. The teal provides a strong accent and brand feel, while beige illustration panels add warmth without clutter. Minor concerns: body text gray appears slightly low-contrast, and the saturated teal used everywhere draws a lot of attention to links, occasionally overpowering nearby headings.*

### 7. Candidate 37
**Overall Gap:** 1.30 (Human: 1.70, AI: 3.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Strong headline hierarchy with large bold sans-serif and playful yellow highlight strokes creates an immediate focal point. However, body copy across sections is noticeably small and tightly leading, especially in the case tiles and testimonial cards, which reduces readability. Thereâ€™s inconsistent typographic treatment between sections: lowercase section header 'I worked on...' vs. titleâ€‘case 'What itâ€™s like working with me', and varying font weights within the hero sentence create a slightly noisy rhythm. Link styling and CTAs are light and undersized relative to surrounding text, weakening hierarchy.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Overall grid feels coherent with generous margins and a clear left-aligned structure in the hero. The testimonial section uses a consistent card module and balanced two-column layout. Issues: the project tiles show inconsistent cropping and awkward negative spaceâ€”one tile has a visible fade band and partially cut device, and thereâ€™s an unusually large gap between tiles, which breaks flow. Card elevations and shadows vary subtly between sections, and CTAs within cards are small relative to the image weight, causing imbalance.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Cohesive warm offâ€‘white base with black/gray typography and a distinct yellow accent used in highlights and small motifs produces a friendly, branded feel. Pastel gradients in project cards complement the palette without clashing. Contrast on headings is strong; body text on cream remains readable. Minor inconsistency arises from mixing multiple soft tints and gradients across cards, but overall the scheme is restrained and intentional.*

### 8. Candidate 54
**Overall Gap:** 1.20 (Human: 2.15, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clean sans-serif system with clear hierarchy: large headline 'I am Jiyoung' establishes entry, supporting paragraph set in lighter weight, and a subtle ghost button with consistent letter-spacing. Navigation and project captions are aligned and restrained. Type scales are consistent between hero and project captions. Minor issues: body copy on the dark hero uses low-contrast gray that trends toward insufficient contrast; project labels are quite small, reducing readability on high-density screens.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout here is another example of really strange horizontal sizing between every section. So navbar and then the case studies are the same width, but then the hero section is super wide. *

AI: *Hero composition is strong, with left-aligned text block balanced by a right-side grid animation and generous negative space. Below the fold, the two-column gallery has consistent gutters but uneven rhythm: tile heights vary significantly (e.g., a very shallow 'strip' thumbnail next to tall mockups), producing visual wobble. Visual weight skews left because multiple dark UI screenshots sit in the left column while lighter panels cluster on the right. Some thumbnails have different background treatments (flat white, gray stage, angled book grid) and shadow intensities, creating inconsistency in how work is presented.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The color here is a fine like just all monochrome. In fact, it's a little too monochrome. *

AI: *Neutral, tasteful palette: deep green-black hero with white text and a white content area keeps focus on work. Accents are minimal and unobtrusive. However, contrast on the hero paragraph and small 'See projects' link is on the low side. The gallery inherits a wide range of colors from thumbnails, leading to a somewhat noisy mix without an on-page accent system tying them together. Overall competent but conservative.*

### 9. Candidate 31
**Overall Gap:** 1.20 (Human: 1.30, AI: 2.50)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is kind of a disaster. If you just look at the header section, everything is almost too bold, she's using bold for everything. From Hey Natalia to Bridging the Gap to Product Designer, all of these are bold. When everything is bold, nothing is bold. 

If you look at the navbar, you see that there's a classic example of super-wide letter space, all-caps design in the word Product Designer. This is another classic rookie mistake in typesetting. 

Another example of a rookie mistake is if you go to her project section. There is a pattern where she uses a vertical divider line between every label for the case studies that she did, but the vertical line is way taller and also very dark, which instead makes the vertical line seem like it grabs too much attention. This is a common pattern of failure. 

Another bad pattern here is if you look at the bottom where in her About Me section she has tons of random bolding in her paragraph text. It's like almost feels like every fifth word here is bolded. And then if you look at the bulleted list inside the body of the text, the bulleted list has too much left-side indent. 

And then she randomly switches from left-align text to center-align text when it comes to her email. *

AI: *Clean sans-serif set with clear H1 hierarchy in the hero, but overall feels generic and under-refined. The ghosted background word behind the portrait in the hero subtly interferes with headline legibility. Project tags above each case study are very small and light, creating low-contrast microtype. The long paragraph block in the 'I am a designer who' section is set too small with tight line-height and long measure, which hurts readability. Button labels ('Read More') are small and lose emphasis within thin outlines.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout in the beginning couplet section is not great, but it's not terrible. But then when you go into the "My skills" and "About me" section, it's really terrible, right? So if you look at the indent right after the title. There's a huge amount of white space. We're thinking that the things under the title start a little bit more to the right for no reason. It doesn't align with anything. And then there's this really strange triangular text pattern that serves no purpose In the skill section.*

AI: *Consistent two-column project teasers and alternating light/dark sections create a predictable rhythm. Mockups are framed neatly in browser/device shells and aligned to a grid. However, spacing is uneven: the stats row under the hero feels compressed compared to the generous white space in project sections. The hero composition is unbalancedâ€”the large cut-out portrait competes with the headline. The four-column 'I am a designer who is' block looks busy with inconsistent icon sizing and irregular baselines, making the section feel cluttered.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There is a consistent attempt to add a color palette between shades of grey and then this blue-green thing. It's not bad, it's not done very well, but it's okay, I guess. *

AI: *Restrained black/white base with a teal/blue accent is professional. Dark project bands provide strong contrast. Issues: accent colors appear slightly inconsistent (teal in hero, bluish icons, greenish CTAs), weakening cohesion. Some elements have low emphasis due to light grays (project metadata, small icons). The faint background word in the hero reduces clarity and introduces unnecessary visual noise.*

### 10. Candidate 4
**Overall Gap:** 1.05 (Human: 2.65, AI: 3.70)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The type usage here is medium to maybe slightly below average. I'm between an average to below average here, and so the main issue I have is that it's using a few too many styles, right? For example, I see a serif font that is large and I see a medium size. I see a small size. I see three sizes. I also see two different weights. I see italics too. And then there's a color change in the typography too. It's really using every single style in the book without necessarily thinking too hard about how necessary that is. You probably could've achieved a lot of the same effects with a lot less typography styles, so that it's a little less messy.*

AI: *Refined serif body type with comfortable leading and consistent rhythm creates a calm, editorial feel. Dates in italic provide a secondary voice without relying on heavy weights. The capsule 'View work' buttons use restrained, small text with even letterâ€‘spacing, reinforcing a sophisticated tone. Minor issues: the hero paragraph runs a bit long (line length feels 90â€“100+ characters), which makes the opening block feel dense; the handwritten name mark introduces a different style that slightly clashes with the otherwise classic serif system; some lighter gray metadata borders on low contrast.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *Layout here is okay, it's not that great, it's not terrible. The main problem here is the navbar and the footer. Let me explain. The navbar is really wide. And the signature of the person in their name, Cecile Parker, at the top is a little too big for the rest of the composition. The footer is actually a little too narrow and is insufficiently separated from the body with white space. The body, the content itself is pretty decent, the layout has enough white space to create hierarchy. And things look decently well organized. *

AI: *Clear twoâ€‘column grid: a narrow left column for labels and a wider right column for descriptions. Consistent vertical spacing between entries and identical pill CTAs maintain rhythm. Margins and gutters feel measured, and alignment of company/title blocks against the descriptions is tidy. The top introduction block is visually heavy relative to subsequent sections and could use tighter width or stronger hierarchy to improve scanability, but overall the composition is disciplined and balanced.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *There really isn't enough to tell too much about the color here. I think generally it's OK, but this is a low confidence OK. *

AI: *Monochrome palette with a single warm accent for links demonstrates restraint and keeps focus on structure. Contrast between text and background is generally solid, but some secondary gray text and thin button borders feel faint. The limited palette shows control but doesnâ€™t display advanced color sensibility beyond minimalism.*

## Common AI Blindspots

**Sloppiness Blindness:**
- Occurred in 5 candidates: 1, 31, 25, 11, 13

**Excess Blindness:**
- Occurred in 1 candidates: 4

**Inconsistency Blindness:**
- Occurred in 2 candidates: 11, 29

## Recommendations for Prompt Improvement

1. **Add explicit inconsistency detection:**
   - AI is missing width/alignment inconsistencies between sections
   - Add specific guidance about checking cross-section consistency

3. **Define 'sloppy' indicators:**
   - AI sees 'clean' where humans see 'sloppy'
   - List specific sloppy indicators: misaligned elements, inconsistent spacing, etc.
