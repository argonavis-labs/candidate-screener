## Top 10 Candidates with Largest Gaps

### 1. Candidate 29
**Overall Gap:** 2.65 (Human: 1.35, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *This is an example of minimalist typography done poorly. Right off the bat, they don't consistently capitalize their sentences. They do it in some places but not others. 

They use emojis instead of bullet points which creates noise and adds a weird indent on the left. Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. 

There's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. 

Then there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. 

They also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason. And then the button outline also doesn't match the stroke width of the text inside the button or frankly anything else on the page. *

AI: *Clean sans-serif system with clear hierarchy. Hero paragraph shows good scale and leading; case study titles are bold and readable with supporting small-caps metadata for categories. Links styled in a distinct blue provide clear affordance. Consistent button treatment ('VIEW' pill with spaced capitals) reinforces system. Minor issues: metadata and nav text run a bit small, and the heavy concentration of blue links in the hero creates a slightly busy reading texture. Overall, type rhythm and spacing feel intentional and consistent.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is another one of those examples of just different for every section.
- The navbar is super wide
- It narrows down into the hero section (which is fine)
- It broadens a little wider again in the body where there's like case studies
I think that the hero and the case study section are technically the same width, but because the text on the hero doesn't run all the way to the right, it feels like it's not the same width. This creates this very awkward and inconsistent right rag.*

AI: *Consistent two-column grid: left image thumbnail/right text repeated creates strong rhythm. Generous white space around each module; clear vertical spacing between sections ('CASE STUDIES' label, 'ADDITIONAL WORK' grid). Thumbnails are aligned and uniformly framed with even padding; buttons and copy align to the same vertical axis, showing attention to alignment. Minor nitpicks: the transition from the stacked case-study list to the two-column 'Additional work' introduces a slight shift in rhythm, and the section headings are visually understated relative to the content weight.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There is sort of like an attempt here at doing sort of like an electric blue driven theme here, but because the case studies are also that backgrounds are sort of completely different colors and then they are very loud.

We're seeing gradients, we're seeing orange, we're seeing very dark blacks. It just takes away from the overall power of the monochrome plus electric blue color palettes. *

AI: *Mostly monochrome with a strong electric-blue accent for links and the footer, which creates a clear visual identity. Case study thumbnails use soft background tints (light blue, peach, purple) that complement the neutral page and help differentiate items. The footer's highly saturated blue adds personality but feels abrupt compared to the otherwise airy page, creating a heavy end-cap. Thumbnail colors vary enough to verge on patchwork in places, but remain controlled overall.*

### 2. Candidate 26
**Overall Gap:** 2.45 (Human: 0.55, AI: 3.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is really bad. The navbar name is way too big, right? Like Melanie Cernak is huge compared to the rest of the site. It probably is not the most important thing on this page. And also it's in awkward all caps and a font that doesn't look very good all capped. 

And then the images - all the text is different sizes and different. Some of them even don't have a body, whereas others have a body and a title. They also kept the logos of the people that they work with really big, and every logo is a different type. Again, makes it really noisy. *

AI: *Headlines are clear and readable with a modern sans serif. The large display scale on cards like the checkout case and the 'OTHER PROJECTS' section creates strong emphasis. However, hierarchy is inconsistent: some cards use all‑caps headlines while others use title/sentence case; supporting copy sizes vary widely. The oversized wordmark on the wide card competes with the headline, creating visual noise. Separator lines under headings vary in length/spacing, adding inconsistency. Body text on several cards is quite small relative to the card size, which reduces readability.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The composition here is really bad.
- The images are all cut off.
- You'll notice that in the Masonry grid of images, the white space around all the images is very inconsistent.
- The type size is inconsistent, and some of the images are even cut off, which is a big no-no.*

AI: *A two‑column grid with even gutters provides basic structure, and the full‑width feature card adds rhythm. Yet internal composition varies: some cards are airy while others feel cramped (e.g., the ATS card with a dense screenshot). The wide card is left‑heavy with a large wordmark and a phone mockup floating close to the right edge, creating imbalance. The 'OTHER PROJECTS' panel uses oversized type that crops near the top edge, which feels abrupt rather than intentional. Margins and baseline alignment of elements inside cards are not consistent, leading to a slightly patchwork feel.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There are too many colors going on here, it's kind of a disaster.
- There's an attempt at doing a pastel color background for all the images, but because there's so many colors in the UI in the foreground, it effectively loses the effect.
- They also kept all the logos of the clients they work with really big, and because all the logos have different colors too, it just totally takes away from the intended effect of the pastel palette.
- There's also some really awkward examples of color usage at the very bottom of the page where they've used full-color social logos (which is already a lot) and on top of it, they've chosen to use a colored outline in teal, which is like tons of color that doesn't mean anything and in a place where it's probably not very important to draw attention to. *

AI: *Soft pastel backgrounds across cards create a friendly, low‑contrast palette and help separate projects. Contrast with black text is generally sufficient. However, the palette lacks cohesion—each card adopts different tints that don’t feel systematized, and embedded screenshots introduce additional conflicting colors. The large mint panel near the bottom adds another hue and dominates the page, throwing off balance. Overall pleasant but not harmonized.*

### 3. Candidate 25
**Overall Gap:** 2.30 (Human: 1.70, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *Typography here is sloppy. So you'll notice that they use all caps for the items in the nav bar where it's not necessary. You also notice that all the headers are sort of like different styles, so their name Matt is a different weight and size than the headers in their images (the AI data assistant). Even though they are very similar, and then the "Open to chat" is also a different style. They just seem very similar but also different, which adds visual noise. *

AI: *Clean, consistent sans-serif system with clear hierarchy. The H1 is well-sized and balanced with generous leading; subhead body text sits at a readable width and contrast. Project cards use a strong left-aligned headline with smaller caption, creating clear visual entry points. Spacing between headline and caption is consistent across cards. Minor nit: captions feel slightly light and tight on some colored backgrounds (e.g., lavender tile), and the scale between the H1 and subhead could use a touch more contrast.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The composition here is mostly awkward from the sloppy images. The image is just like there's no consistency in how they're laid out. *

AI: *Projects are presented as large, consistent modules: text anchored left, imagery right, with ample negative space and aligned gutters. The rhythm between sections is even, and the repeated curved motif creates continuity. Hero-to-project spacing is comfortable, and the CTA band at the bottom provides a clear stop. Small issues: slight variance in card heights and image framing (device mock vs browser window) introduces mild inconsistency; some arcs feel clipped a bit abruptly at the edges on the first two tiles.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The colors here almost have a system, but not quite. The first two images have a multi-colored background that is in the same hue. It's not super but it's working-ish. But then they do something completely different in the third and fourth images where it's just a solid pastel background. They also use a laptop picture for the third image, which is a bit more realistic, but doesn't really work well with their more UI-driven stuff for the first, second, and fourth images. *

AI: *Pleasant, cohesive palette of soft pastels paired with deeper blues/purples. Background blocks differentiate projects without feeling noisy. Contrast remains readable on all sections; the yellow project is bold yet controlled. Minor opportunities: the lavender card’s dark-blue accent is heavy compared to the subtle teal above, and caption text on tinted backgrounds could benefit from a touch more contrast.*

### 4. Candidate 37
**Overall Gap:** 1.95 (Human: 1.70, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clear hierarchy and confident type scale. The hero uses a bold, high-contrast sans-serif for the headline with lighter-weight body text below, creating strong visual emphasis. Yellow "marker" highlights over selected words add personality without breaking readability. Section headers (e.g., "I worked on…", "What it's like working with me") maintain consistent sizing and tracking. Body copy line length is generally comfortable. Minor issues: small, light-gray body text in testimonial cards reduces contrast; the blue-styled phrase within the hero headline introduces a second link treatment inside a display line which slightly muddies hierarchy; some micro-spacing around highlighted words feels a bit tight relative to line height.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Overall grid is coherent with generous spacing and tidy card modules (rounded corners, consistent shadows). Device mockups are placed with considered angles and captions align to a clear left edge. However, there are rhythm breaks: a noticeably large vertical gap appears between the second and third project cards, disrupting flow; the testimonials section shows uneven vertical spacing between cards and varying text block heights, creating a slightly wobbly baseline; the logo row near the bottom has inconsistent logo sizes and optical alignment, which makes the grid feel loose. These issues keep the composition from feeling truly tight.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *A warm off-white canvas with restrained accents feels cohesive. The yellow highlight motif ties hero and section headings together; soft pastel tints behind project cards complement the neutral base; black text provides strong contrast for key headlines. Secondary blue accents are used sparingly. Minor concern: small gray body text in testimonials edges toward low contrast against the cream background, and mixing bright blue link styling inside the hero headline introduces a touch of color noise.*

### 5. Candidate 54
**Overall Gap:** 1.85 (Human: 2.15, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Refined sans-serif system with clear hierarchy. The hero headline 'I am Jiyoung' is sized prominently with comfortable tracking, and the paragraph copy shows good line-height and narrow measure for readability. Project titles and metadata are consistently styled and aligned beneath thumbnails. However, several text elements are on the small side (top nav label and project captions feel sub-12px) and use low-contrast gray on dark/white backgrounds, which slightly hurts legibility. The hero animation snapshot shows truncated text ('Design Should Delig'), indicating a small polish issue.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout here is another example of really strange horizontal sizing between every section. So navbar and then the case studies are the same width, but then the hero section is super wide. *

AI: *Strong, minimal composition. The hero balances a left text block with a right dotted visual, creating a clean asymmetry and generous negative space. The portfolio uses a disciplined two-column grid with consistent gutters and margins; thumbnails carry subtle shadows and are well-framed, producing a professional gallery feel. Minor issues: mixed thumbnail heights create uneven vertical rhythm in places (e.g., the tall collage on the right versus shorter card on the left), and some baselines of captions don’t perfectly align across the grid, slightly reducing cohesion.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The color here is a fine like just all monochrome. In fact, it's a little too monochrome. *

AI: *Restrained, tasteful palette. A deep slate hero contrasts with white body sections, while light grays are used for surfaces and dividers, letting the work imagery carry color. The discipline avoids visual noise and feels premium. Small drawbacks: body/caption text occasionally dips into low-contrast gray, and the hero background is quite dark, which paired with fine-weight text can feel a touch muted.*

### 6. Candidate 13
**Overall Gap:** 1.75 (Human: 2.25, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *They used a pretty interesting serif here that I think is a sign that they have thought about this. The body also uses a relatively interesting looking model. But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. *

AI: *Strong typographic voice. The oversized serif H1 ('User Researcher + Designer') is well‑spaced and tightly kerned, creating a clear focal point. Pairing a sturdy serif for headings with a clean sans (nav labels and section captions like UNDERSTAND/ITERATE/REFINE) and a mono/sans body gives contrast and hierarchy. Links are consistently styled in teal with subtle underlines, adding scannability. Weaknesses: body copy in the three columns is quite small with tight leading, making the dense bullet lists feel cramped; the nav type is very small and light, reducing balance at the top. Overall, tasteful pairing and hierarchy with minor readability/scale issues.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.

So, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The "See my work" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. *

AI: *Clear structure and rhythm: a dominant centered hero headline, followed by a tidy three‑column grid with consistent gutters and evenly sized illustration tiles. Generous outer margins and whitespace keep the page airy. The CTA button is centered with ample padding and aligns visually with the column grid, creating a clean end to the fold. Minor issues: the dense lists under each column create uneven vertical weight; the left‑anchored name in the header and centered H1 introduce slight asymmetry that feels a bit detached; overall hierarchy is strong but not impeccable.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *They chose a pretty interesting pair of colors for the green and the yellow. I think it's actually quite good because of their complementarity*

AI: *Cohesive palette of deep teal, warm beige, and charcoal. The beige tiles with teal line illustrations provide pleasant contrast and a distinctive, consistent look across the three cards. Teal is used judiciously for links, brand mark, and the outlined CTA, tying the system together. Contrast on white is solid; the outline CTA is intentionally subtle but could be more assertive for emphasis. No clashing hues or overuse—restrained and tasteful.*

### 7. Candidate 7
**Overall Gap:** 1.70 (Human: 1.30, AI: 3.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is kind of a disaster:
- The DM on the top left is way too big compared to the rest of the elements in the nav bar
- There's not enough white space between the hello I'm Dorna and the content underneath it
- The description of herself is right-aligned, which is almost always a mistake*

AI: *Strengths: Clean sans-serif across the site with a clear H1 and consistent card titles/subtitles. Hierarchy is readable (bold project titles, lighter descriptions). Weaknesses: Several small type sizes reduce polish (top-right nav and card descriptions look ~12–13px and low-contrast gray). The center-aligned intro paragraph has a wide measure and loose spacing compared to the tighter card copy, creating inconsistent rhythm. Some captions sit very close to card edges while others have more breathing room, suggesting inconsistent leading and padding.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *This is one of the word layouts I've seen. They are going for a left-right, left-right effect, but because the vertical space between the different cards is not the same as the horizontal space, it creates this awkward gap that takes away from the effectiveness of the design. 

At the bottom of the page, you'll also see a section that says "Like what you see?" I think this is supposed to fit in the left-right, left-right grid, but because there's no card around it again, it doesn't seem like that. So if they had to either add a card in the background or have that happy its own section. It was a bad choice to put it in the zigzag layout because, really, this is almost like a different concept. All that everything in the zigzag layout is a case study, whereas this is a call to action. So it probably should have been its own layout. *

AI: *Strengths: The two-column card grid has generous whitespace and predictable gutters; overall balance is calm and scannable. Weaknesses: Card internals feel uneven—screenshots sit on colored panels with inconsistent framing/margins (e.g., the "Navigation Redesign" and "Updates Page" cards have noticeably different image-to-edge spacing). Shadows are heavy and vary by card, adding visual noise. The large coral Lyft tile dominates the visual hierarchy and breaks rhythm. The bottom CTA section (“Like what you see?”) is not aligned to the card grid and the two buttons float with mismatched visual weight, reducing compositional cohesion.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The color here is a consistent cut pastel palette on top of a generally more monochrome website design with a slight highlight. It's mostly fine. It's not a particularly well-executed pastel color palette, but it's not bad either. *

AI: *Strengths: Pastel accent blocks (yellow, orange, lavender, mint, coral) add personality and help differentiate projects. Weaknesses: Palette feels ad hoc rather than systematized—saturation and temperature swing from very pale yellow to saturated coral, creating an uneven cadence across the grid. Some text sits on very light card backgrounds with subtle shadows, reducing perceived contrast. Black CTA buttons at the bottom clash with the otherwise soft palette and feel visually heavy.*

### 8. Candidate 31
**Overall Gap:** 1.55 (Human: 1.30, AI: 2.85)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is kind of a disaster. If you just look at the header section, everything is almost too bold, she's using bold for everything. From Hey Natalia to Bridging the Gap to Product Designer, all of these are bold. When everything is bold, nothing is bold. 

If you look at the navbar, you see that there's a classic example of super-wide letter space, all-caps design in the word Product Designer. This is another classic rookie mistake in typesetting. 

Another example of a rookie mistake is if you go to her project section. There is a pattern where she uses a vertical divider line between every label for the case studies that she did, but the vertical line is way taller and also very dark, which instead makes the vertical line seem like it grabs too much attention. This is a common pattern of failure. 

Another bad pattern here is if you look at the bottom where in her About Me section she has tons of random bolding in her paragraph text. It's like almost feels like every fifth word here is bolded. And then if you look at the bulleted list inside the body of the text, the bulleted list has too much left-side indent. 

And then she randomly switches from left-align text to center-align text when it comes to her email. *

AI: *Clear sans-serif system with consistent heading weights and a readable H1/H2 hierarchy in the hero. Meta labels above project titles use small caps/letterspacing effectively to separate information. However, body text is set quite small with tight line-height, especially in the long 'I am a designer who' section where the measure spans very wide lines, creating dense, fatiguing blocks. CTAs ('Read More') are small and feel visually timid; the thin outline style further reduces typographic emphasis. Some secondary copy in the stats row and hero appears light-gray on white, lowering contrast.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout in the beginning couplet section is not great, but it's not terrible. But then when you go into the "My skills" and "About me" section, it's really terrible, right? So if you look at the indent right after the title. There's a huge amount of white space. We're thinking that the things under the title start a little bit more to the right for no reason. It doesn't align with anything. And then there's this really strange triangular text pattern that serves no purpose In the skill section.*

AI: *Overall composition is organized and balanced: a consistent grid with left text/right mockup pairings, clear sectioning, and strong rhythm created by alternating light and dark bands. Browser-frame mockups are aligned and framed consistently, and negative space is generally well used. Weaknesses: imagery is undersized relative to the generous whitespace, causing some sections to feel empty; the four-column 'I am a designer who is' block has uneven vertical rhythm (icons and captions don’t baseline-align), and the stats row has large gaps that make hierarchy feel diluted.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There is a consistent attempt to add a color palette between shades of grey and then this blue-green thing. It's not bad, it's not done very well, but it's okay, I guess. *

AI: *A restrained monochrome palette with a teal accent is applied consistently across links, dividers, and icons. Alternating dark sections add contrast and help spotlight the work. However, the palette feels conservative and somewhat sterile, with minimal accent use to drive emphasis. Outline CTAs on dark backgrounds are low visual priority. Some gray meta text on white trends toward low contrast.*

### 9. Candidate 28
**Overall Gap:** 1.35 (Human: 2.35, AI: 3.70)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clear hierarchy with a strong display headline set in a modern sans, followed by lighter body copy for intro; section headers ('Experience', 'Education', 'Toolbox', 'More') are consistently larger and bolder, creating scannability. Role titles use weight contrast against company names (italic/regular) and dates in smaller size, which reads cleanly on both light and dark backgrounds. Minor craft issues: on the dark section the body text lines feel a bit dense with tight line-height, and long bullet lines reduce readability; occasional mixed separators (vertical bars, bullets, italics) add slight typographic noise.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Strong grid and rhythm: left rail for section titles with content in a right column, generous margins, and consistent spacing between major sections. The hero balances left-aligned copy with a right-side visual, leaving ample negative space. The 'Toolbox' and 'More' areas use clean multi-column layouts with even gutters and alignments. Minor issues: the large black band for Experience/Education is visually heavy, and spacing between individual roles appears slightly inconsistent in places; some bullet lists run long within a single wide column, creating visual density mid-page.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Minimal palette of black, white, and light gray is clean and high-contrast. The soft multi-hue gradient in the hero adds an accent and helps balance the composition. However, the gradient (yellow/green/blue) and a small purple wordmark feel loosely related, suggesting a less cohesive color system. The pure black section creates a stark break that can feel heavy compared to the otherwise airy page.*

### 10. Candidate 52
**Overall Gap:** 1.35 (Human: 2.00, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clear primary hierarchy with a bold, uppercase hero name ('TAYLOR CHE') and tracked subhead creates an immediate focal point. However, secondary hierarchy is weak: project titles like 'Sunflower', 'Xbox', and 'UCLA Library' are very small and light, competing with equally light captions beneath the images. Mixed casing/styles (all-caps in hero and nav vs. casual 'Let's chat!' headings) reduce typographic cohesion. Link text in the footer appears similar to body copy, lacking a distinct typographic treatment. Overall legible, but scale, weight, and style consistency could be tighter.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *A disciplined single-column grid with consistent card width gives the page a clean rhythm. Generous white space between project blocks and centered alignment keep focus on the thumbnails. The collage-style thumbnails (torn paper edges, tape, layered textures) are well-framed and balanced within their rectangles. The patterned divider under the hero provides a visual break. Minor issues: the hero occupies a very tall area, pushing work too far down, and the footer two-column section feels lighter structurally than the project area. Still, overall composition shows above-average craft.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Color choices are playful and mostly cohesive with muted, paper-like tones in the thumbnails. Contrast is sufficient for the white hero type on deep maroon. However, the maroon hero paired with the saturated moss-green patterned strip introduces a slightly jarring transition. Throughout the page, there’s no clear, consistent accent color for interactive elements, making links blend into body text. The palette supports the scrapbook aesthetic but lacks refinement in transitions and emphasis.*

## Common AI Blindspots

**Sloppiness Blindness:**
- Occurred in 5 candidates: 11, 1, 13, 25

**Inconsistency Blindness:**
- Occurred in 3 candidates: 11, 29, 26

## Recommendations for Prompt Improvement

1. **Add explicit inconsistency detection:**
   - AI is missing width/alignment inconsistencies between sections
   - Add specific guidance about checking cross-section consistency

3. **Define 'sloppy' indicators:**
   - AI sees 'clean' where humans see 'sloppy'
   - List specific sloppy indicators: misaligned elements, inconsistent spacing, etc.
