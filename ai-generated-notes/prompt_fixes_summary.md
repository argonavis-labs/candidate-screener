# Prompt Pipeline Fixes Summary

## Changes Applied (December 2024)

### ✅ 1. Fixed Scale Consistency (1-5 Scale)
- **core-prompt.md**: Already correctly using 1-5 scale ✓
- **rubric.json**: Confirmed using 1-5 scale ("Terrible" to "Fantastic") ✓
- **examplars.json**: Cleaned up decimal scores to integers (1-5) ✓
- **generated-prompt.md**: Regenerated with correct 1-5 scale ✓

### ✅ 2. Enhanced Minimalism Appreciation

#### Added to core-prompt.md:
- New section: "**Recognize minimalist excellence**"
  - Achieving more with less is a sign of mastery
  - Single typeface with subtle variations can be sophisticated
  - Monochrome palettes can demonstrate exceptional restraint
  - Simple layouts with perfect execution deserve high scores
  - Don't penalize minimal approaches - evaluate their effectiveness

#### Enhanced rubric.json:

**Typography good anchors added:**
- "Excellence through restraint - using single typeface with subtle weight/color variations shows sophistication"
- "Sophisticated use of minimal typography systems - achieving hierarchy through subtle techniques"

**Layout good anchors added:**
- "Innovative layouts: Creative approaches like chat interfaces, newspaper columns, or unique navigation patterns"
- "Achieving more with less - minimal layouts that are highly effective"

**Color good anchors added:**
- "Monochrome mastery - all-grey/black/white palettes can be excellent when used with intentional variation"
- "Less is more - restraint in color usage can demonstrate sophistication"
- "Subtle color techniques: using shades of grey or minimal accent colors to create hierarchy"

### ✅ 3. Improved Red Flag Definitions

**Enhanced sloppy_images definition:**
From: "they show their work, but it's sloppily laid out and you can't see what's going on."
To: "they show their work, but it's sloppily laid out - wrong zoom level, generic device mockups without customization, inconsistent image treatments, poor quality/compression artifacts, can't see what's going on"

**Enhanced template_scent_high definition:**
From: "the site clearly feels like it was template"
To: "the site clearly feels like it was from a template - generic layouts, standard components, no customization"

### ✅ 4. Fixed Typos
- "hierchy" → "hierarchy"
- "well-chosing" → "well-chosen"
- "rythm" → "rhythm"
- "constrast" → "contrast"
- "their used" → "they're used"

## Files Modified
1. `/core-prompt.md` - Added minimalism recognition section
2. `/rubric.json` - Enhanced good anchors and red flag definitions
3. `/examplars.json` - Cleaned up scores to integers
4. `/generated-prompt.md` - Regenerated with all improvements

## Verification Steps
All files now consistently use:
- 1-5 scoring scale
- Enhanced appreciation for minimalist design
- Better detection criteria for sloppy images
- Clearer guidance on evaluating restraint as a positive

## Next Steps
1. Run new evaluations with the improved prompt
2. Compare results with human evaluations
3. Monitor for improved alignment, especially on minimalist portfolios
4. Target metrics:
   - Correlation with human scores >0.75
   - Mean absolute error <0.5 points
   - Better detection of sloppy images (>80% accuracy)

## Expected Impact
These changes should significantly improve:
- Recognition of minimalist excellence (candidates 8, 14, 32, 35, 44, 45, 46)
- Detection of poorly presented work
- Overall alignment with human expert judgment
- Reduced bias against monochrome and single-typeface designs
