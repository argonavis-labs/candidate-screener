I think the approach here is a little bit of elevated basics. It uses a lot of the sort of browser default of black and blue but just does them slightly better. You can tell from the line spacing and the general restraint in the color usage and the stop restraint in the number of styles that it's a someone who is good at typography but didn't necessarily want to push it super far in this specific design.

And generally, I think that there is good use of white space here to create hierarchy and sections. They use a restrained amount of visuals, but all the visuals have a consistent style and layout that is effective. Because the visuals are really strong, they've kept the typography and the layout relatively minimal, which I think was an effective strategy. ",
