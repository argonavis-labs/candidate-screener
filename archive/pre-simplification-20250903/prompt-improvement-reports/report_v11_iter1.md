## Top 10 Candidates with Largest Gaps

### 1. Candidate 11
**Overall Gap:** 1.55 (Human: 1.80, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is not terrible in the spacing, but it has some problems in terms of typesetting. A few examples in the navbar they use this all-caps, wide letter spacing design which is usually a bad sign. 

They then use a different outline for the selected tab that makes it look like a button instead of a selected tab, which confuses two patterns. 

They also selected a font that I think doesn't really work well at large sizes. It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, "Hello, I'm Hayley" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. 

There's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.

Using an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste. If we're going to make something really important in your site, it probably shouldn't be a default emoji. *

AI: *Clean sans-serif choice with solid rendering, but the type system feels basic. The hero heading is only slightly larger than the body copy, creating a weak hierarchy for the page intro. Navigation mixes a bordered 'WORK' button with plain text links, which introduces inconsistent typographic treatment. Footer lists use very small text with tight line-height, so the link blocks read a bit cramped compared to the generous spacing elsewhere.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is trying to be relatively minimal but it's not really working that well because:
- The navbar is super wide (takes up the whole width of the screen)
- The content of the body is very narrow
- The footer is wide again, but the footer is not as wide as the navbar
Inconsistent.

And then speaking of the footer, you'll notice that it's this very strange layout where the work section is really long and the about section is really short. This creates a lot of white space towards the right side. Work and about are top-aligned, but then the social icons are center-aligned. This inconsistency creates some ugly white space. *

AI: *The grid of nine project tiles is tight and consistent with equal gutters and aligned edges, creating a strong, orderly focal area. Centered hero copy with ample white space above the grid yields a calm rhythm. The footer’s two-column list and right-aligned socials balance well across the full width. Minor issues: the boxed 'WORK' control draws disproportionate attention in the top-right, and the footer block feels visually disconnected due to a large gap before it.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The use of color here is fine. I think that keeping all the color in the middle is working well for her. And all the colors are sort of like a nice contrasting blue and red and various shades of it. So that's working fine.*

AI: *Site chrome stays neutral (white and light gray) which lets work thumbnails carry color. This keeps things clean, but the overall palette relies heavily on the highly saturated, varied project tiles, producing some visual noise (adjacent bright oranges, teals, and blues compete). The single accent link color in the hero is subtle but underutilized; there’s no cohesive accent system tying navigation, links, and CTAs together.*

**Red Flags:**
- Human: ['template_scent_high']
- AI: None

### 2. Candidate 13
**Overall Gap:** 1.40 (Human: 2.25, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *They used a pretty interesting serif here that I think is a sign that they have thought about this. The body also uses a relatively interesting looking model. But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. *

AI: *Strong display choice for the H1: a bold serif with tight tracking creates a confident hero. Name lockup in the top-left uses the same serif in a brand color, establishing identity. However, the secondary typography reduces the overall craft: body copy under the three columns is set in a small mono/tech face with tight line-height, which hurts readability at this scale. The all-caps micro-headings (UNDERSTAND / ITERATE / REFINE) are light, small, and compete with the body; they don’t establish a clear hierarchy. The nav links in the top-right are tiny with generous letterspacing, adding more micro-type that feels fussy. Link lists use bullets + underlines, creating visual noise and a crowded feel in narrow columns.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.

So, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The "See my work" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. *

AI: *Clean, considered grid. The three-column section aligns consistently: equal image blocks, even gutters, and predictable spacing from image to heading to list. Generous whitespace keeps the page airy, and the centered CTA at the bottom provides a clear visual stop. Minor issues prevent a 5: the centered hero stack sits slightly disconnected from the left-aligned three-column grid below, creating alignment tension; vertical rhythm between the hero copy and the card row feels a touch loose. Still, overall composition shows above-average control.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *They chose a pretty interesting pair of colors for the green and the yellow. I think it's actually quite good because of their complementarity*

AI: *Cohesive palette of teal, cream/beige, and black on white. The teal is used consistently for logo, links, icons, and CTA outline; the beige illustration tiles add warmth and unify the three cards. Contrast is sufficient on white; teal on beige illustrations reads clearly. The palette is tasteful but somewhat limited—no nuanced tints/tones or elevation cues—so it feels flat in places, preventing a top-tier score.*

### 3. Candidate 12
**Overall Gap:** 0.65 (Human: 4.65, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Clean sans-serif system type (Inter/SF-like) with clear hierarchy: bold name/handle, lighter tagline, and consistent body text in chat bubbles. Spacing and line-height inside bubbles feel balanced, and microcopy in UI chips is legible. The icon+label row under the header is compact and maintains weight contrast. Minor issues keep it from a 5: the grey bubble text appears slightly low-contrast against the very light bubble fill, and the tiny metadata in some cards feels a touch small relative to the generous paddings, creating a scale mismatch.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *The conversation motif creates a strong, intentional vertical rhythm with generous negative space and a consistent central column. Bubble shapes, cards, and icon pills align cleanly; spacing between elements is mostly even, and depth is conveyed with subtle shadows. The project card cluster and wallpaper card are well-contained and visually grouped. Small nits: alternating left/right bubbles occasionally disrupt a strict grid feel; the two-card module shows slight height mismatch leading to a ragged bottom edge; and the social icon pill is a bit narrow vertically compared to adjacent bubble sizing.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *A restrained palette—cool blues for primary bubbles/CTAs, neutral greys for secondary messages, and a soft radial background—creates focus and cohesion. Shadows and subtle gradients add depth without heavy noise. Contrast is generally good, but the light grey bubbles close to a white background flirt with insufficient separation, and the heavy blue for CTAs could use a slightly lighter hover/pressed state for nuance.*

### 4. Candidate 10
**Overall Gap:** 0.65 (Human: 1.65, AI: 2.30)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Body copy uses a default-looking serif while navigation/buttons use a sans, creating a mismatched pairing without a clear system. There’s little hierarchy—most text is the same size/weight, with no distinct headings. Inline links are bright default blue and underlined, visually noisy against the body text. The bullet list uses manual bullets (•) with uneven indentation and line spacing, signaling weak typographic structure.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Two-column composition feels imbalanced: the circular avatar floats on the right without alignment to a baseline or grid. The right-side callout cards sit awkwardly beside left-column paragraphs and don’t align to shared edges, producing uneven negative space. Horizontal rules separate sections but spacing above/below them is inconsistent. Logos and badges in the education section break the grid and collide with text density, adding visual clutter.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *A restrained blue-on-white palette provides basic coherence, and CTAs use a darker blue for contrast. However, saturation and value are inconsistent—navigation is a very light blue while CTAs are highly saturated. Default bright-blue links and multicolored logos (e.g., bee and seal) introduce palette noise and weaken cohesion.*

### 5. Candidate 1
**Overall Gap:** 0.00 (Human: 3.65, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The type chooses a cool serif and it has a strong contrast with some of the small dates. It doesn't do much, but what it does, it does well. My one small feedback is that the work play contact section on the right doesn't seem as well done as the main text. But if you look at the main text, it's pretty good. *

AI: *Strong typographic voice using a high-contrast italic serif creates a distinct identity and draws focus. Tracking/kerning looks carefully tuned; the ragged-right paragraphs have even rhythm without awkward rivers. Blue accent on the name and a keyword establishes emphasis. However, setting the entire hero in italic reduces readability for long lines, and hierarchy is limited (nearly all lines share the same size/weight). The blue link styling used on two separate words can imply inconsistent semantics.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *I think the layout is a little bit weak here. It doesn't do much, so I expect everything to be really good. But the work-play-contact section feels a little random and not super well-positioned with regard to everything else. *

AI: *Minimal composition with generous negative space feels intentional and calm. The left-aligned text block sits comfortably in a wide canvas, but the line length is long, reducing scanability. The vertical, rotated right-side navigation (Work | Play | Contact) feels visually detached from the main block and does not align to a clear grid with the floating up-arrow in the top-right, creating slight imbalance. Overall, solid but not exceptionally composed.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *This is generally pretty decent. On color usage, it uses one main color which is blue and then it carries it between the background and the highlight for the text. It's not super sophisticated, but what it does, it does decently well. *

AI: *Restrained palette of very light gray background, deep graphite text, and a vivid cobalt accent yields excellent contrast and a refined feel. Accent color is used sparingly to draw the eye. Because the page is largely monochrome with a single accent and few elements, there’s limited demonstration of more complex color systems, but what’s shown is tasteful and consistent.*
