## Top 10 Candidates with Largest Gaps

### 1. Candidate 29
**Overall Gap:** 2.35 (Human: 1.35, AI: 3.70)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *This is an example of minimalist typography done poorly. Right off the bat, they don't consistently capitalize their sentences. They do it in some places but not others. 

They use emojis instead of bullet points which creates noise and adds a weird indent on the left. Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. 

There's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. 

Then there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. 

They also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason. And then the button outline also doesn't match the stroke width of the text inside the button or frankly anything else on the page. *

AI: *Clean sans-serif system with consistent weight usage and hierarchy: large bold H1 in the hero, mid-weight titles for each case, small-caps/letter-spaced labels (e.g., 'WEB', 'MOBILE'), and outlined pill CTAs with uppercase type. Alignment and spacing between headings, descriptions, and CTAs are consistent across cards. Minor issues keep it from a 5: body copy appears a bit small relative to headings; the hero paragraph spans a long line length, reducing readability; and the CTA pill text is slightly tight vertically in the outline, creating a cramped feel.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is another one of those examples of just different for every section.
- The navbar is super wide
- It narrows down into the hero section (which is fine)
- It broadens a little wider again in the body where there's like case studies
I think that the hero and the case study section are technically the same width, but because the text on the hero doesn't run all the way to the right, it feels like it's not the same width. This creates this very awkward and inconsistent right rag.*

AI: *Strong grid and rhythm: repeated pattern of left-aligned image with right-aligned text creates a clear scan path. Section dividers ('CASE STUDIES', 'ADDITIONAL WORK') are subtle and provide structure. Generous whitespace around each card and consistent margins keep the page airy. Additional work section forms a tidy two-column grid with balanced image-to-text ratios. Small shortcomings: slight variation in thumbnail heights introduces minor rhythm breaks, and the 'VIEW' pill occasionally sits at different vertical positions relative to the description, which interrupts alignment perfection.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There is sort of like an attempt here at doing sort of like an electric blue driven theme here, but because the case studies are also that backgrounds are sort of completely different colors and then they are very loud.

We're seeing gradients, we're seeing orange, we're seeing very dark blacks. It just takes away from the overall power of the monochrome plus electric blue color palettes. *

AI: *Neutral foundation (white/black/gray) with a blue accent provides clarity, but cohesion is weakened by highly varied thumbnail background colors (pastels, black, peach, light blue) that don’t share a clear system. The saturated full-width blue footer is visually heavy compared to the lighter mid-page palette, making the end feel disconnected. CTAs use a thin gray outline that reads a bit low-contrast next to some thumbnail colors.*

**Red Flags:**

### 2. Candidate 37
**Overall Gap:** 2.00 (Human: 1.70, AI: 3.70)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clear hierarchy with a strong type scale in the hero: large bold headline contrasted with lighter supporting copy creates immediate focus. Consistent left alignment and generous line-height improve readability across sections. The yellow marker-style highlights add emphasis without breaking alignment. Minor issues keep it from a 5: the hero mixes several weights and emphases (bold phrases plus three separate yellow highlights) which feel slightly busy, and testimonial cards have small, dense body text on a warm background that edges toward low contrast.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Overall composition is orderly with a clear grid and strong vertical rhythm. Project cards are consistently sized with coherent padding, rounded corners, and balanced shadows; sections are well separated with ample white space. The testimonial area shows consistent card styling and spacing. Small blemishes: angled device mockups fight the otherwise rectilinear grid, and the hero has a lot of visual elements (patterned background, portrait, star, multiple highlights) competing for attention, slightly reducing compositional clarity.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Cohesive palette of off‑white, warm beige, black, and a single yellow accent that ties together highlights and section backgrounds. However, the dotted texture plus pale section tints introduce visual noise, and some text on the warm beige testimonial panel trends low in contrast. Multiple soft pastel backdrops behind project tiles add variation but start to feel inconsistent, reducing overall color discipline.*

### 3. Candidate 52
**Overall Gap:** 2.00 (Human: 2.00, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Strong headline treatment: large, tightly set sans-serif in all caps establishes clear hierarchy against the textured maroon hero. Navigation labels (WORK/PLAY/ABOUT) are minimal and consistent. Secondary subhead uses spaced small caps that feel intentional. Pairing with the playful handwritten-style headings in the footer adds personality without clashing. Weaknesses: project captions under thumbnails are very small, low-contrast gray on white, which reduces readability; some microcopy in the footer looks light and could use increased size/line-height. Overall system feels curated and consistent but not flawless.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Crisp, centered column with generous white space produces a calm reading rhythm. Project tiles share consistent width and alignment, with balanced margins and breathing room between sections. The collage/taped-paper presentations are well-contained and don’t break the grid. Minor issues: the patterned divider between hero and work adds visual noise and slightly interrupts the otherwise clean vertical rhythm; captions align left while images are centered, creating a small alignment tension.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Cohesive palette: deep maroon hero, muted greens, and parchment neutrals echo the collage theme and feel intentional. High-contrast white headline on maroon reads clearly. The patterned green strip and red/green collage backgrounds are harmonious and distinctive. Small drawbacks: gray caption text on white is low contrast; the decorative pattern can feel a bit busy on first load.*

### 4. Candidate 25
**Overall Gap:** 1.95 (Human: 1.70, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *Typography here is sloppy. So you'll notice that they use all caps for the items in the nav bar where it's not necessary. You also notice that all the headers are sort of like different styles, so their name Matt is a different weight and size than the headers in their images (the AI data assistant). Even though they are very similar, and then the "Open to chat" is also a different style. They just seem very similar but also different, which adds visual noise. *

AI: *Clean sans-serif system with consistent weights and clear project titles. However, several choices keep it at average: the centered hero paragraph creates a weak reading rhythm and looks slightly long for the measure; the small, light 'company' labels under project titles feel under-weighted on tinted backgrounds; the 'Send an Email' pill uses a very thin border that visually competes with the large 'Open to chat!' headline, causing imbalance. Overall hierarchy works but lacks refinement and typographic nuance.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The composition here is mostly awkward from the sloppy images. The image is just like there's no consistency in how they're laid out. *

AI: *Strong, repeatable card pattern with generous whitespace and left-aligned titles paired with right-aligned mockups. Colored panels frame the work well and maintain consistent margins; imagery is crisp and well-cropped. The rhythm from section to section is steady and scannable. Minor nits: the 'Open to chat' band is somewhat tall relative to its content and the repeated block structure borders on monotony, but alignment and spacing are solid throughout.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The colors here almost have a system, but not quite. The first two images have a multi-colored background that is in the same hue. It's not super but it's working-ish. But then they do something completely different in the third and fourth images where it's just a solid pastel background. They also use a laptop picture for the third image, which is a bit more realistic, but doesn't really work well with their more UI-driven stuff for the first, second, and fourth images. *

AI: *Distinct palettes per project (teal/blue, lavender/navy, neutral gray, warm yellow) create clear separation and a contemporary feel. Contrast between text and backgrounds remains readable, and gradients are controlled. A few areas push saturation (e.g., deep navy next to lavender) which slightly reduces elegance, but overall the color usage is cohesive and intentional.*

**Red Flags:**

### 5. Candidate 7
**Overall Gap:** 1.70 (Human: 1.30, AI: 3.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is kind of a disaster:
- The DM on the top left is way too big compared to the rest of the elements in the nav bar
- There's not enough white space between the hello I'm Dorna and the content underneath it
- The description of herself is right-aligned, which is almost always a mistake*

AI: *Clean, readable sans-serif across the site with a clear scale (large hero headline, medium card titles, small descriptions). Hierarchy is adequate but not refined: hero is center-aligned while all project text is left-aligned, creating a disjointed rhythm. Card titles are close in size/weight to body copy, reducing emphasis. Long line length in the hero paragraph and light weight text in cards make the content feel a bit airy. Overall solid but fairly standard and lacking typographic nuance or distinctive pairing.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *This is one of the word layouts I've seen. They are going for a left-right, left-right effect, but because the vertical space between the different cards is not the same as the horizontal space, it creates this awkward gap that takes away from the effectiveness of the design. 

At the bottom of the page, you'll also see a section that says "Like what you see?" I think this is supposed to fit in the left-right, left-right grid, but because there's no card around it again, it doesn't seem like that. So if they had to either add a card in the background or have that happy its own section. It was a bad choice to put it in the zigzag layout because, really, this is almost like a different concept. All that everything in the zigzag layout is a case study, whereas this is a call to action. So it probably should have been its own layout. *

AI: *Two-column masonry grid uses generous white space and consistent card padding; thumbnails sit above text with clear structure. However, the staggered grid starts misaligned under the centered hero, making the top section feel unanchored. Vertical rhythm varies: the gap from hero to first row is larger than inter-card spacing, and card heights cause uneven baselines that draw the eye. Shadows on cards add depth but feel generic and slightly heavy, softening overall crispness. CTA section at the bottom shifts to a different alignment and spacing pattern, breaking flow.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The color here is a consistent cut pastel palette on top of a generally more monochrome website design with a slight highlight. It's mostly fine. It's not a particularly well-executed pastel color palette, but it's not bad either. *

AI: *Pastel backplates behind thumbnails (yellow, orange, purple, mint, teal) add friendliness and help differentiate projects. Yet the palette feels ad hoc rather than systematic; saturation and hue vary widely, so the grid lacks a cohesive color story. The heavy black buttons and text links contrast sharply with the soft card colors and white background, creating small tonal clashes. Nothing is egregious, but the color system could be more intentional and restrained.*

**Red Flags:**

### 6. Candidate 11
**Overall Gap:** 1.40 (Human: 1.80, AI: 3.20)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is not terrible in the spacing, but it has some problems in terms of typesetting. A few examples in the navbar they use this all-caps, wide letter spacing design which is usually a bad sign. 

They then use a different outline for the selected tab that makes it look like a button instead of a selected tab, which confuses two patterns. 

They also selected a font that I think doesn't really work well at large sizes. It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, "Hello, I'm Hayley" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. 

There's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.

Using an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste. If we're going to make something really important in your site, it probably shouldn't be a default emoji. *

AI: *Clean sans-serif system with clear hierarchy: a modest hero heading, smaller supporting copy with comfortable line-height, and a subtle underlined CTA. Navigation uses a distinct outlined 'Work' button paired with lighter text links, which establishes primary/secondary hierarchy. Footer lists are small but readable with adequate spacing. Minor issues: mixed link treatments (outlined button vs plain text) feel slightly inconsistent, and the hero heading could be a touch larger for stronger emphasis.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is trying to be relatively minimal but it's not really working that well because:
- The navbar is super wide (takes up the whole width of the screen)
- The content of the body is very narrow
- The footer is wide again, but the footer is not as wide as the navbar
Inconsistent.

And then speaking of the footer, you'll notice that it's this very strange layout where the work section is really long and the about section is really short. This creates a lot of white space towards the right side. Work and about are top-aligned, but then the social icons are center-aligned. This inconsistency creates some ugly white space. *

AI: *Strong grid discipline: a 3x3 gallery with equal-sized tiles and consistent gutters creates a tight visual rhythm. Centered hero, generous margins, and clear separation between the gallery and a structured footer provide balance. Alignment across sections feels tidy. Weaknesses: the large light-gray footer block is visually heavy relative to the minimal header, and the overall structure follows a common pattern without distinctive compositional moves.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The use of color here is fine. I think that keeping all the color in the middle is working well for her. And all the colors are sort of like a nice contrasting blue and red and various shades of it. So that's working fine.*

AI: *Neutral page chrome (black/white/gray) lets colorful thumbnails stand out. The vibrant tile set adds energy but introduces a patchwork of unrelated hues, creating some visual noise and reducing cohesion. The CTA/link color does not clearly tie into a defined palette, and the gray footer slightly dulls the overall color harmony. Nothing is egregious, but the palette feels curated at the project level more than at the site level.*

### 7. Candidate 13
**Overall Gap:** 1.40 (Human: 2.25, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *They used a pretty interesting serif here that I think is a sign that they have thought about this. The body also uses a relatively interesting looking model. But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. *

AI: *Strong display serif in the hero (“User Researcher + Designer”) creates an immediate focal point and pairs well with a clean sans for UI text. However, the type scale is extreme: the hero is very large while body copy and link lists are quite small with tight leading, producing a dense texture and reduced readability. Section labels in small all‑caps sans feel under‑sized relative to the illustrations. Multiple treatments (serif display, all‑caps sans, underlined link lists) add slight style noise and weaken hierarchy.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.

So, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The "See my work" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. *

AI: *Clear, consistent three‑column grid with uniform illustration tiles establishes rhythm and balance. Generous white space and a simple top navigation keep focus on the core modules. Visual hierarchy is logical: hero → three columns → CTA. Minor issues: the centered hero block shifts to left‑aligned content below, creating an abrupt alignment change; the text blocks under each illustration are cramped compared to the generous image area; vertical spacing between the hero subhead and the card row feels tighter than spacing within the card modules, slightly disrupting flow.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *They chose a pretty interesting pair of colors for the green and the yellow. I think it's actually quite good because of their complementarity*

AI: *Restrained palette of deep teal, cream, and soft beige feels cohesive and distinctive. Consistent use of teal for headings, links, and the outline CTA ties elements together, and the beige illustration panels add warmth without clutter. Contrast is generally strong, though the outline button and very small body text push the limits of clarity on the light background. Palette is tasteful but a bit monotone, with limited secondary accents for emphasis.*

### 8. Candidate 54
**Overall Gap:** 1.20 (Human: 2.15, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Clean sans-serif throughout with decent hierarchy (large hero heading, small captions). However, several text sizes are too small, reducing readability—e.g., the 'See projects' label and project captions sit at very small sizes with light weight. The outlined CTA in the hero uses thin text that feels delicate on a dark background. Hierarchy between the hero H1 and paragraph is modest rather than punchy, and letter-spacing on small grey labels feels tight. The animated 'Design Should Delig…' wordmark appears truncated, which subtly hurts polish.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout here is another example of really strange horizontal sizing between every section. So navbar and then the case studies are the same width, but then the hero section is super wide. *

AI: *Strong macro composition: an asymmetrical hero with text left and a subtle grid/animation right creates balance and generous negative space. The two-column project grid maintains consistent column gutters and margins, and thumbnails are well-aligned horizontally. Minor issues: the large dead zone between the hero and the grid (with a tiny arrow) feels like unnecessary empty space; varying thumbnail heights create uneven vertical rhythm; spacing between images and their captions is not perfectly consistent across tiles.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The color here is a fine like just all monochrome. In fact, it's a little too monochrome. *

AI: *Tasteful, restrained palette: a deep charcoal hero with white type provides solid contrast, and the mostly neutral page lets project imagery stand out. However, there is no clear accent system; some tiles use different grey backplates while others are pure white or black, producing a slightly inconsistent look. Several small elements (arrow, tiny labels) use low-contrast grey, reducing clarity on both dark and light backgrounds.*

### 9. Candidate 31
**Overall Gap:** 1.20 (Human: 1.30, AI: 2.50)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is kind of a disaster. If you just look at the header section, everything is almost too bold, she's using bold for everything. From Hey Natalia to Bridging the Gap to Product Designer, all of these are bold. When everything is bold, nothing is bold. 

If you look at the navbar, you see that there's a classic example of super-wide letter space, all-caps design in the word Product Designer. This is another classic rookie mistake in typesetting. 

Another example of a rookie mistake is if you go to her project section. There is a pattern where she uses a vertical divider line between every label for the case studies that she did, but the vertical line is way taller and also very dark, which instead makes the vertical line seem like it grabs too much attention. This is a common pattern of failure. 

Another bad pattern here is if you look at the bottom where in her About Me section she has tons of random bolding in her paragraph text. It's like almost feels like every fifth word here is bolded. And then if you look at the bulleted list inside the body of the text, the bulleted list has too much left-side indent. 

And then she randomly switches from left-align text to center-align text when it comes to her email. *

AI: *Clean single sans-serif choice with clear hierarchy in the hero (large headline vs smaller supporting copy). However, typographic polish is uneven: project meta labels above titles are very small and low-contrast—especially on the dark sections—hurting readability; headings like “Redesigning Permission Management” have tight line-height causing cramped stacking compared to the more relaxed hero; inconsistent weight usage across CTAs (thin "Read more" on dark panels vs bolder CTAs in hero) breaks rhythm; the stats row uses very light, narrow numerals with tiny captions that feel under-weighted.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout in the beginning couplet section is not great, but it's not terrible. But then when you go into the "My skills" and "About me" section, it's really terrible, right? So if you look at the indent right after the title. There's a huge amount of white space. We're thinking that the things under the title start a little bit more to the right for no reason. It doesn't align with anything. And then there's this really strange triangular text pattern that serves no purpose In the skill section.*

AI: *Overall grid is conventional and mostly aligned (two-column hero, alternating image/text project blocks). Visual rhythm is disrupted by inconsistent spacing: large airy gap in the stats row compared to tighter project sections; "Read more" buttons sit at varying distances from body copy; screenshots and text blocks are not vertically aligned (e.g., dark project panels where the image sits slightly higher than the text block). Alternating full-width light/dark sections adds contrast but feels template-like and causes abrupt transitions instead of a cohesive flow.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There is a consistent attempt to add a color palette between shades of grey and then this blue-green thing. It's not bad, it's not done very well, but it's okay, I guess. *

AI: *Safe monochrome base with a teal accent provides a professional look. Contrast on dark sections is strong and images pop. However, accent usage is inconsistent (different teal tones between icons and buttons), and some elements rely on very light gray text on dark backgrounds for metadata, reducing clarity. The palette feels generic and lacks a refined system (e.g., ghost buttons on dark background have minimal presence compared to hero CTAs).*

### 10. Candidate 26
**Overall Gap:** 1.15 (Human: 0.55, AI: 1.70)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The typography here is really bad. The navbar name is way too big, right? Like Melanie Cernak is huge compared to the rest of the site. It probably is not the most important thing on this page. And also it's in awkward all caps and a font that doesn't look very good all capped. 

And then the images - all the text is different sizes and different. Some of them even don't have a body, whereas others have a body and a title. They also kept the logos of the people that they work with really big, and every logo is a different type. Again, makes it really noisy. *

AI: *Type hierarchy is inconsistent across project tiles. The 'Checkout Flow Redesign' card uses an oversized bold headline while adjacent cards (e.g., 'Expungement Service', 'ATS Integration') use much smaller weights and sizes, creating uneven rhythm. Gray body copy on pastel backdrops is low contrast and thin, especially under 'ATS Integration' and 'Designing a health curriculum'. Decorative elements like the long underline rules vary in thickness and spacing from the headings. The 'OTHER PROJECTS' block uses extremely large, tightly tracked uppercase that feels heavy and cropped, reducing legibility.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The composition here is really bad.
- The images are all cut off.
- You'll notice that in the Masonry grid of images, the white space around all the images is very inconsistent.
- The type size is inconsistent, and some of the images are even cut off, which is a big no-no.*

AI: *The 2‑column grid lacks consistent alignment and spacing. Card heights vary significantly, producing awkward gutters and jumps; the wide 'TOPHATTER' section spans and then collapses back to two smaller cards without a clear rhythm. Inside cards, elements crowd edges (the phone mockup on the right nearly touches the border; the 'GoodHire + JazzHR' screenshot is cramped while the right side has excess empty space). The 'OTHER PROJECTS' panel truncates the large headline and overlaps with a partial mobile screen on the right, which reads as accidental rather than intentional art direction.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There are too many colors going on here, it's kind of a disaster.
- There's an attempt at doing a pastel color background for all the images, but because there's so many colors in the UI in the foreground, it effectively loses the effect.
- They also kept all the logos of the clients they work with really big, and because all the logos have different colors too, it just totally takes away from the intended effect of the pastel palette.
- There's also some really awkward examples of color usage at the very bottom of the page where they've used full-color social logos (which is already a lot) and on top of it, they've chosen to use a colored outline in teal, which is like tons of color that doesn't mean anything and in a place where it's probably not very important to draw attention to. *

AI: *Color usage is not cohesive: each tile introduces different pastel backdrops (light blue, peach, gray, teal) with no unifying palette, making the page feel piecemeal. Several combinations have weak contrast (dark gray type on peach and light blue). Accent tags like 'Social change' introduce yet another neutral tint and style. Overall the palette feels borrowed from individual projects rather than an orchestrated portfolio system.*

   - AI is missing width/alignment inconsistencies between sections
   - Add specific guidance about checking cross-section consistency

3. **Define 'sloppy' indicators:**
   - AI sees 'clean' where humans see 'sloppy'
   - List specific sloppy indicators: misaligned elements, inconsistent spacing, etc.
