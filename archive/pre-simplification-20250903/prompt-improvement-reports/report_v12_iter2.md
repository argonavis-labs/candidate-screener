## Top 10 Candidates with Largest Gaps

### 1. Candidate 11
**Overall Gap:** 1.55 (Human: 1.80, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is not terrible in the spacing, but it has some problems in terms of typesetting. A few examples in the navbar they use this all-caps, wide letter spacing design which is usually a bad sign. 

They then use a different outline for the selected tab that makes it look like a button instead of a selected tab, which confuses two patterns. 

They also selected a font that I think doesn't really work well at large sizes. It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, "Hello, I'm Hayley" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. 

There's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.

Using an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste. If we're going to make something really important in your site, it probably shouldn't be a default emoji. *

AI: *Clean, single sans-serif system/Inter-style family used consistently. Headline and subhead are tightly grouped and center aligned, which reads cleanly, but the overall scale feels small and conservative for a hero (headline roughly body-sized). The nav highlights 'WORK' with a stroked pill while the other nav items are plain text, creating an inconsistent typographic treatment. Footer link lists are set in small sizes with tight leading and minimal separation between items, reducing hierarchy. Overall competent but not particularly refined or expressive.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is trying to be relatively minimal but it's not really working that well because:
- The navbar is super wide (takes up the whole width of the screen)
- The content of the body is very narrow
- The footer is wide again, but the footer is not as wide as the navbar
Inconsistent.

And then speaking of the footer, you'll notice that it's this very strange layout where the work section is really long and the about section is really short. This creates a lot of white space towards the right side. Work and about are top-aligned, but then the social icons are center-aligned. This inconsistency creates some ugly white space. *

AI: *Strong, simple composition anchored by a 3x3 square tile grid with consistent gutters and equal image sizes, creating a clear focal area. Generous whitespace above the grid gives breathing room and the centered hero copy is well aligned with the grid below. The footer switches to a full-width grey block with two text columns on the left and social on the right—generally tidy, though the footer columns feel a touch cramped relative to the airy grid. Overall, spacing, alignment, and rhythm are coherent and above average.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The use of color here is fine. I think that keeping all the color in the middle is working well for her. And all the colors are sort of like a nice contrasting blue and red and various shades of it. So that's working fine.*

AI: *The site chrome stays neutral (black on white with a light grey footer), letting project tiles supply color. The tiles are vivid and mostly harmonious individually, but the grid arrangement places two strong oranges adjacent in the middle row, creating a heavy warm cluster that slightly unbalances the composition. The accent link color in the hero is subtle and restrained. Competent color handling with minor balance issues.*

**Red Flags:**
- Human: ['template_scent_high']
- AI: None

### 2. Candidate 13
**Overall Gap:** 1.40 (Human: 2.25, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *They used a pretty interesting serif here that I think is a sign that they have thought about this. The body also uses a relatively interesting looking model. But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. *

AI: *Strong serif + sans pairing gives the page character: a bold display serif for the hero ('User Researcher + Designer') contrasted with a clean sans for navigation, section labels, and body. Hierarchy at the top is clear. However, several choices reduce polish: the intro paragraph under the hero is very small and tightly letter‑spaced, hurting readability; the all‑caps nav and section labels ('UNDERSTAND / ITERATE / REFINE') feel over‑tracked and a bit shouty; and the long lists of links below each column have equal visual weight (underlines + teal) which competes with the headings. Overall competent but not highly refined.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.

So, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The "See my work" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. *

AI: *Composition is intentional and tidy: a centered hero followed by a clear three‑column grid with consistent card sizes, gutters, and spacing. The illustrations align nicely to their respective columns and the CTA is centered with adequate breathing room. White space is used confidently around the hero and between modules. Minor rough edges: mixed alignments at the top (logo left, nav right, hero centered) create slight tension, and the dense link lists introduce visual noise and uneven column heights.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *They chose a pretty interesting pair of colors for the green and the yellow. I think it's actually quite good because of their complementarity*

AI: *Restrained, cohesive palette of teal, warm cream, and charcoal. The teal is consistently applied to the logo, links, icons/illustrations, and CTA outline, tying the page together. The cream illustration panels soften the page without competing with content. Minor nit: heavy repetition of teal underlined links creates a busy texture in the lists, and the cream panels slightly reduce overall crispness, keeping it short of exceptional.*

### 3. Candidate 10
**Overall Gap:** 0.70 (Human: 1.65, AI: 2.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Body copy is set in a generic serif (looks like Georgia/Times) while the top nav and CTAs use a sans, creating an unintentional serif/sans mix without a clear role for each. Hierarchy is weak: multiple paragraphs share nearly the same size and weight, with no clear H1 or section titles; the two horizontal separators do more work than type to signal sections. Links use a default-looking bright blue underline that clashes with the deeper accent blues elsewhere and reads unrefined. The CTA cards on the right use different sizing/weight treatment than the left column copy, further fragmenting the system.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *There is a consistent two-column motif (text left, small card/photo right) and generous whitespace that keeps the page airy. However, vertical rhythm is uneven: very large gaps between sections compared to the tighter spacing inside paragraphs cause jumps in flow. Alignment shifts at the footer—content becomes centered and uses different widths—breaking the grid established above. The right-column cards feel visually light compared to dense left text blocks, producing imbalance. Still, the overall grid is simple and mostly coherent.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Palette relies on white with blue accents, but the blues are inconsistent: default link blue (underlined) sits next to a darker navy for buttons and a pale blue card background. The red Gmail icon and dark circular photo background introduce competing accents that don’t tie back to the core palette. Shadows/tints on the right-hand cards read as default, adding little sophistication. Color is restrained but lacks harmony and refinement.*

### 4. Candidate 1
**Overall Gap:** 0.35 (Human: 3.65, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The type chooses a cool serif and it has a strong contrast with some of the small dates. It doesn't do much, but what it does, it does well. My one small feedback is that the work play contact section on the right doesn't seem as well done as the main text. But if you look at the main text, it's pretty good. *

AI: *Strong editorial typographic voice. The hero uses a high-contrast serif in italic for the entire intro, likely a quality display face, with restrained weight usage and clear hierarchy via size and a single blue link style for emphasis (name and company). Micro-typographic touches like smaller, superscripted year ranges show attention to detail. However, setting the full paragraph in italic reduces legibility for long measures and the leading feels a touch tight for the large size, making blocks feel dense.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *I think the layout is a little bit weak here. It doesn't do much, so I expect everything to be really good. But the work-play-contact section feels a little random and not super well-positioned with regard to everything else. *

AI: *Minimal, confident composition anchored by a large left-aligned text block with ample negative space around it. The rotated right-rail nav (Work | Play | Contact) introduces a subtle asymmetric tension and a clear focal point without clutter. Spacing between lines and paragraphs is consistent, and elements align cleanly. Minor drawbacks: line length appears on the long side for such large type, and the vertical nav, while elegant, slightly competes with the hero for attention.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *This is generally pretty decent. On color usage, it uses one main color which is blue and then it carries it between the background and the highlight for the text. It's not super sophisticated, but what it does, it does decently well. *

AI: *Refined, restrained palette: a cool light gray background, deep slate text, and a single saturated royal blue accent for links. The accent is used sparingly and consistently, creating hierarchy. The non‑pure black text choice feels intentional. Slight concern that the blue is very vivid compared to the otherwise muted palette and the slate-on-gray contrast could be increased a bit for optimal readability.*

### 5. Candidate 12
**Overall Gap:** 0.00 (Human: 4.65, AI: 4.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Clean, restrained sans-serif system typography with a tight, consistent style set. Hierarchy is created through weight and size only: bold name/headline vs. regular body in chat bubbles; smaller chip-style metadata; and lighter captions in the cards. Line length is controlled by the chat-bubble width, keeping reading comfortable. Letter-spacing and leading are balanced, with no erratic switches in alignment. Minor nit: secondary text inside the project cards trends small and lighter (low-contrast gray), which slightly hurts readability and keeps it from a perfect score.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 5
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Inventive, coherent chat-style composition executed with precision. Alternating pill bubbles establish a strong vertical rhythm and clear focal flow down the page. Spacing between bubbles is consistent; gutters feel intentional. Embedded project cards maintain the same corner radius language and sit neatly within the conversation stream without breaking alignment. Generous white space and a single centered column make the structure feel airy and confident. No random width shifts or competing columns; everything aligns to a clear grid.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 5
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Sophisticated, restrained palette: soft light-gray background gradient provides depth; neutral gray bubbles for secondary messages contrasted with a single saturated blue for primary accents and CTAs. The blue is used sparingly to direct attention. Subtle, diffuse shadows and glows match the light palette and avoid harsh defaults. Project imagery introduces color without overwhelming the system because the surrounding UI remains neutral.*

## Recommendations for Prompt Improvement

3. **Define 'sloppy' indicators:**
   - AI sees 'clean' where humans see 'sloppy'
   - List specific sloppy indicators: misaligned elements, inconsistent spacing, etc.

5. **General calibration adjustment:**
   - AI overrates 80% of portfolios
   - Consider adding guidance to be more critical overall
   - Emphasize looking for flaws before strengths
