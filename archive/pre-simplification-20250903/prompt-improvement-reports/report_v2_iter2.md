## Top 10 Candidates with Largest Gaps

### 1. Candidate 11
**Overall Gap:** 1.55 (Human: 1.80, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is not terrible in the spacing, but it has some problems in terms of typesetting. A few examples in the navbar they use this all-caps, wide letter spacing design which is usually a bad sign. 

They then use a different outline for the selected tab that makes it look like a button instead of a selected tab, which confuses two patterns. 

They also selected a font that I think doesn't really work well at large sizes. It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, "Hello, I'm Hayley" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. 

There's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.

Using an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste. If we're going to make something really important in your site, it probably shouldn't be a default emoji. *

AI: *Basic sans-serif throughout with limited scale and hierarchy. The hero uses a modest bold heading and two small centered lines; the lack of distinct size/weight steps makes the hierarchy feel flat. The top-right nav mixes a bordered 'WORK' pill next to lightweight links, creating inconsistent emphasis. Footer links are very small with tight leading on a light gray background, reducing legibility and signaling limited attention to micro-typography.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is trying to be relatively minimal but it's not really working that well because:
- The navbar is super wide (takes up the whole width of the screen)
- The content of the body is very narrow
- The footer is wide again, but the footer is not as wide as the navbar
Inconsistent.

And then speaking of the footer, you'll notice that it's this very strange layout where the work section is really long and the about section is really short. This creates a lot of white space towards the right side. Work and about are top-aligned, but then the social icons are center-aligned. This inconsistency creates some ugly white space. *

AI: *Clean, balanced composition. The 3x3 project grid is evenly spaced with consistent gutters and alignment. Generous white space around the grid gives breathing room and a clear visual rhythm. Header, gallery, and footer are clearly separated with consistent margins; footer columns align neatly. Minor weakness: the centered hero block feels visually light compared to the heavy grid below, and the solitary 'Let's chat' link floats without strong anchoring.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The use of color here is fine. I think that keeping all the color in the middle is working well for her. And all the colors are sort of like a nice contrasting blue and red and various shades of it. So that's working fine.*

AI: *Neutral page chrome (white and very light gray) keeps focus on thumbnails, which are highly saturated and diverse. While vibrant, the mix of unrelated colors across tiles creates a patchwork that adds visual noise. The green 'Let's chat' link introduces a new accent not echoed elsewhere, and the black-outlined 'WORK' pill draws disproportionate attention. Overall, acceptable but not refined as a cohesive palette.*

**Red Flags:**
- Human: ['template_scent_high']
- AI: None

### 2. Candidate 13
**Overall Gap:** 1.40 (Human: 2.25, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *They used a pretty interesting serif here that I think is a sign that they have thought about this. The body also uses a relatively interesting looking model. But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. *

AI: *Strong, characterful display serif in the hero establishes hierarchy, and the serif/sans pairing feels intentional. However, micro-typography weakens the craft: the intro paragraph is very small with tight line-height, reducing readability; section labels (UNDERSTAND / ITERATE / REFINE) are set in small caps with wide tracking that feels fussy; list items use underlined teal links that look default and visually noisy. The mix of sizes and letterâ€‘spacing creates a slightly uneven rhythm across sections.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.

So, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The "See my work" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. *

AI: *Clear grid and strong alignment: centered hero, three evenly sized illustration tiles with consistent gutters, and balanced top-left name vs top-right nav. Good spacing around the hero and a clear focal CTA centered below. Minor issues: the three columns below the tiles have uneven text depths, creating a ragged baseline; the dense bullet lists crowd the lower halves compared to the airy top, slightly disrupting vertical rhythm.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *They chose a pretty interesting pair of colors for the green and the yellow. I think it's actually quite good because of their complementarity*

AI: *Cohesive, restrained palette of deep teal, cream, and light beige. The teal provides a clear accent for links and CTAs, and the illustrations harmonize with the palette. Contrast is generally solid, though beige tiles against the white page feel a bit muted, and teal underlined links become visually busy in long lists.*

### 3. Candidate 12
**Overall Gap:** 0.65 (Human: 4.65, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Clean, modern sans-serif (likely Inter/SF) with consistent weight usage. Strong hierarchy at the top: bold name, lighter handle, and compact link pills. Chat-bubble copy is sized and line-spaced for readability, and uses weight/color to differentiate speaker states (white on blue vs dark on light gray). Micro-typography in the app cards (titles vs descriptions) is well-scaled and aligned. Minor nit: some gray-on-gray body text inside bubbles trends a bit low-contrast and small, especially under the project cards.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Single-column conversational layout is thoughtfully composed with generous negative space and a clear vertical rhythm. Consistent rounded rectangles, shadows, and pill elements create cohesive grouping. The dual-card module sits neatly within a rounded container with even internal gutters; subsequent single card and social-icon row maintain alignment to the same column. Visual pacing from intro to CTA feels intentional. Small quibble: many highly rounded modules and shadows accumulate visual softness, which slightly reduces edge clarity and hierarchy snap.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Restrained palette: soft neutral background with a subtle vignette/gradient, blue primary for key bubbles/CTA, and light grays for secondary bubbles. Contrast is generally solid and the blue accent provides clear emphasis. Cards introduce controlled pops of color without breaking cohesion. Minor issue: a few secondary text areas inside gray bubbles verge on low contrast; the heavy use of soft shadows adds haze, slightly muting crispness.*

### 4. Candidate 10
**Overall Gap:** 0.65 (Human: 1.65, AI: 2.30)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Body copy is set in a generic serif that looks unrefined (Georgia/Times-like) with tight leading, producing dense paragraphs. Hierarchy is weak: multiple sections use the same size/weight, so the eye lacks clear entry points. The top nav is a tiny sans-serif that clashes with the serif body, and the 'Let's connect' heading barely differs in size/weight from surrounding text. Links use default-looking blue underlines and appear visually loud against the otherwise subdued text. Buttons in the right-side cards use different sizes/weights from the body and look disconnected. Overall, inconsistent pairing and weak hierarchy reduce typographic craft.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *The page uses a loose two-column structure but alignment is inconsistent. The circular headshot floats on the right without a strong baseline or grid relation to the intro copy, creating imbalance. Horizontal rules separate sections but the vertical rhythm around them is uneven (large gaps above/below) leading to dead space. The right-side callout cards are not vertically aligned to the related text blocks and their widths/padding feel arbitrary, which breaks rhythm. Overall, the composition feels sparse with too much empty space and misaligned elements, indicating below-average layout craft.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clean, high-contrast white background with dark text is safe. However, the blue system lacks cohesion: nav highlight is a pale blue, links are a brighter default blue, and CTAs use a deeper navy plus a light blue card backgroundâ€”three or more distinct blues with no clear system. The LinkedIn/Gmail icons introduce additional accent colors that don't tie back to the palette. Nothing is egregious, but the palette feels generic and unsystematic rather than intentional.*

### 5. Candidate 1
**Overall Gap:** 0.35 (Human: 3.65, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The type chooses a cool serif and it has a strong contrast with some of the small dates. It doesn't do much, but what it does, it does well. My one small feedback is that the work play contact section on the right doesn't seem as well done as the main text. But if you look at the main text, it's pretty good. *

AI: *Elegant display serif used at hero scale creates a strong editorial voice. The name is distinguished with a saturated blue link, giving a clear entry point. Line breaks are intentional and produce a readable rag; overall spacing between lines is consistent. However, the entire paragraph set in italic reduces long-form legibility, and the small superscript-style dates create a slightly uneven baseline rhythm. The rotated, micro-sized sans-serif in the right-side nav introduces a secondary style that feels a bit detached from the main serif treatment.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *I think the layout is a little bit weak here. It doesn't do much, so I expect everything to be really good. But the work-play-contact section feels a little random and not super well-positioned with regard to everything else. *

AI: *Single-column typographic block is placed left-of-center with generous negative space, producing a clean, confident composition. The right-edge vertical nav and small top-right control create a balanced frame around the content. Alignment is crisp with a tidy left edge and comfortable margins. Minor issues: the rotated vertical nav competes slightly with the hero block and introduces visual tension; the composition is very minimal, offering limited hierarchical layers beyond the hero paragraph.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *This is generally pretty decent. On color usage, it uses one main color which is blue and then it carries it between the background and the highlight for the text. It's not super sophisticated, but what it does, it does decently well. *

AI: *Restrained palette: soft light-gray background, charcoal text, and a vivid royal-blue accent. Contrast is strong and the blue accent effectively draws attention to the name without overusing color. The accent is slightly more saturated than the otherwise muted scheme, which can feel a bit sharp, and the palette shows limited tonal nuance beyond the single accent.*
