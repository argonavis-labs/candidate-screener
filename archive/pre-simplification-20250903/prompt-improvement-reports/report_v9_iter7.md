## Top 10 Candidates with Largest Gaps

### 1. Candidate 7
**Overall Gap:** 2.40 (Human: 1.30, AI: 3.70)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is kind of a disaster:
- The DM on the top left is way too big compared to the rest of the elements in the nav bar
- There's not enough white space between the hello I'm Dorna and the content underneath it
- The description of herself is right-aligned, which is almost always a mistake*

AI: *Clear sans-serif system with strong hierarchy: the hero headline is large, well-kerned, and sets a confident tone. Card titles use consistent weight and size; secondary descriptions drop in size and color to establish hierarchy. Spacing inside cards (title > description > metadata) feels even and readable. Minor issues: long centered intro paragraph reads a bit dense, and some secondary gray text on cards appears slightly low-contrast, which softens clarity.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *This is one of the word layouts I've seen. They are going for a left-right, left-right effect, but because the vertical space between the different cards is not the same as the horizontal space, it creates this awkward gap that takes away from the effectiveness of the design. 

At the bottom of the page, you'll also see a section that says "Like what you see?" I think this is supposed to fit in the left-right, left-right grid, but because there's no card around it again, it doesn't seem like that. So if they had to either add a card in the background or have that happy its own section. It was a bad choice to put it in the zigzag layout because, really, this is almost like a different concept. All that everything in the zigzag layout is a case study, whereas this is a call to action. So it probably should have been its own layout. *

AI: *Well-structured two-column grid with consistent gutters and generous white space. Cards are aligned and use a subtle elevation/shadow consistently, creating a tidy rhythm. The colored backplates behind thumbnails add depth and a staggered, masonry feel without breaking alignment. Minor weaknesses: variable card heights create some vertical rhythm breaks, and the centered hero block sits slightly disconnected from the left/right grid start, causing a mild alignment tension at the fold.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The color here is a consistent cut pastel palette on top of a generally more monochrome website design with a slight highlight. It's mostly fine. It's not a particularly well-executed pastel color palette, but it's not bad either. *

AI: *Pastel accent blocks (yellow, peach, lilac, mint, aqua, salmon) are tasteful individually and keep the page light, but the variety feels somewhat arbitrary and creates a patchwork effect rather than a tightly systematized palette. Black-filled CTAs contrast well but read visually heavier than the rest of the soft palette. Secondary gray body copy verges on low contrast in places.*

### 2. Candidate 31
**Overall Gap:** 2.40 (Human: 1.30, AI: 3.70)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is kind of a disaster. If you just look at the header section, everything is almost too bold, she's using bold for everything. From Hey Natalia to Bridging the Gap to Product Designer, all of these are bold. When everything is bold, nothing is bold. 

If you look at the navbar, you see that there's a classic example of super-wide letter space, all-caps design in the word Product Designer. This is another classic rookie mistake in typesetting. 

Another example of a rookie mistake is if you go to her project section. There is a pattern where she uses a vertical divider line between every label for the case studies that she did, but the vertical line is way taller and also very dark, which instead makes the vertical line seem like it grabs too much attention. This is a common pattern of failure. 

Another bad pattern here is if you look at the bottom where in her About Me section she has tons of random bolding in her paragraph text. It's like almost feels like every fifth word here is bolded. And then if you look at the bulleted list inside the body of the text, the bulleted list has too much left-side indent. 

And then she randomly switches from left-align text to center-align text when it comes to her email. *

AI: *Clean sans-serif system with clear weight hierarchy (bold H1 in hero, medium subheads, regular body). Section labels in small caps provide scannability and consistent rhythm. Type is generally well-spaced and aligned across light and dark sections. However, the long text block near the bottom has a small size and long measure, reducing readability; meta lines above project titles look slightly tight in line-height/letter-spacing; the underlined 'I am a designer who is' headline uses a thin rule that feels visually detached. Overall strong, but a few micro-typographic issues hold it back from excellent.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout in the beginning couplet section is not great, but it's not terrible. But then when you go into the "My skills" and "About me" section, it's really terrible, right? So if you look at the indent right after the title. There's a huge amount of white space. We're thinking that the things under the title start a little bit more to the right for no reason. It doesn't align with anything. And then there's this really strange triangular text pattern that serves no purpose In the skill section.*

AI: *Solid grid and rhythm: a consistent two-column structure with text left and framed screenshots right, and alternating light/dark bands that provide clear section separation. Good use of negative space around project thumbnails; browser/device frames are evenly scaled and aligned. Minor composition issues: the hero background word subtly overlaps the headshot creating visual noise; the 'Clients/metrics' row leaves large horizontal dead space between columns; 'Read more' buttons are not vertically aligned consistently to the text blocks; some sections feel slightly left-heavy due to wide margins on the right. Overall, balanced and professional.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There is a consistent attempt to add a color palette between shades of grey and then this blue-green thing. It's not bad, it's not done very well, but it's okay, I guess. *

AI: *Restrained palette of white/black with a teal accent yields a clean, coherent look and strong contrast on dark sections. Accent is used consistently on buttons and small details. Yet the palette is generic and lacks refinement in a few spots: light gray metadata on white verges on low contrast; the oversized, ultra-light background word in the hero introduces unnecessary visual noise; teal usage is sparse and sometimes feels disconnected from imagery. Competent but not distinctive.*

### 3. Candidate 29
**Overall Gap:** 2.35 (Human: 1.35, AI: 3.70)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *This is an example of minimalist typography done poorly. Right off the bat, they don't consistently capitalize their sentences. They do it in some places but not others. 

They use emojis instead of bullet points which creates noise and adds a weird indent on the left. Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. 

There's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. 

Then there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. 

They also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason. And then the button outline also doesn't match the stroke width of the text inside the button or frankly anything else on the page. *

AI: *Clear hierarchy with bold sans-serif headings (e.g., project titles like 'LeanData Journey Tracker') contrasted against lighter body copy. Small, letter-spaced meta labels (e.g., 'CONVERSATION DESIGN, UI DESIGN') add secondary hierarchy. Line length and leading are comfortable throughout, and link styling in the hero uses a distinct blue to indicate interactivity. Minor drawbacks: the hero paragraph stacks many inline links, creating visual noise and slightly weakening scannability; the 'VIEW' pill text is a bit small relative to the button shape, reducing legibility at a glance.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is another one of those examples of just different for every section.
- The navbar is super wide
- It narrows down into the hero section (which is fine)
- It broadens a little wider again in the body where there's like case studies
I think that the hero and the case study section are technically the same width, but because the text on the hero doesn't run all the way to the right, it feels like it's not the same width. This creates this very awkward and inconsistent right rag.*

AI: *Consistent two-column rhythm: thumbnails on the left with ample gutter and aligned text blocks to the right; spacing between project rows is even and breathing room is generous. Section transitions are clear with uppercase labels ('CASE STUDIES', 'ADDITIONAL WORK'). CTA pills are consistently placed under descriptions. Minor issues: section headers are centered while content is left-aligned, introducing a slight alignment tension; the very large bottom callout band shifts the visual weight abruptly compared to the airy sections above.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *There is sort of like an attempt here at doing sort of like an electric blue driven theme here, but because the case studies are also that backgrounds are sort of completely different colors and then they are very loud.

We're seeing gradients, we're seeing orange, we're seeing very dark blacks. It just takes away from the overall power of the monochrome plus electric blue color palettes. *

AI: *Core palette is disciplined (black/gray text, white background, bright blue accents). The blue footer creates a strong, memorable anchor. However, project thumbnails bring varied background colors (black, peach, multiple blues, gradients) that compete with the site’s accent and reduce overall cohesion. The large saturated blue footer, while distinctive, feels heavy against the otherwise light page and creates a jarring final transition.*

### 4. Candidate 25
**Overall Gap:** 2.30 (Human: 1.70, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *Typography here is sloppy. So you'll notice that they use all caps for the items in the nav bar where it's not necessary. You also notice that all the headers are sort of like different styles, so their name Matt is a different weight and size than the headers in their images (the AI data assistant). Even though they are very similar, and then the "Open to chat" is also a different style. They just seem very similar but also different, which adds visual noise. *

AI: *Clean sans-serif system with clear hierarchy: large, well-weighted name/header; bold project titles on each tile; smaller meta line below. Consistent weight usage and adequate line height in body copy. Buttons and labels use concise, legible styles. Minor issues prevent a 5: center-justified intro paragraph runs a bit wide for its size, reducing readability; slight inconsistency in letterspacing between the large CTA 'Open to chat!' and project titles; icon label sizing under the hero feels visually light compared to surrounding text.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The composition here is mostly awkward from the sloppy images. The image is just like there's no consistency in how they're laid out. *

AI: *Strong sectional rhythm with spacious gutters and consistent left alignment for project titles paired with imagery anchored to the right. The repeated project tiles have predictable padding and whitespace, producing good scanability. Hero-to-project transition is clean; footer CTA block provides a visual pause. Minor compositional quirks: the top nav/photo center alignment competes with left-aligned nav text, creating a slight tension; vertical paddings vary subtly between tiles; in the third project tile the clustered device mockups create a heavier right-weight than the others, reducing balance.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The colors here almost have a system, but not quite. The first two images have a multi-colored background that is in the same hue. It's not super but it's working-ish. But then they do something completely different in the third and fourth images where it's just a solid pastel background. They also use a laptop picture for the third image, which is a bit more realistic, but doesn't really work well with their more UI-driven stuff for the first, second, and fourth images. *

AI: *Pleasant, contemporary palette: soft teal, lavender, light gray, and a warm yellow give each tile a distinct identity while remaining cohesive. Good contrast of black text on pastel backgrounds; tasteful use of gradients/shapes to add depth. Minor mismatches: the bright yellow tile is noticeably more saturated than the others and can dominate the page; the light gray CTA band is slightly low-energy relative to the vibrant tiles, producing a small dip in visual momentum.*

**Red Flags:**

### 5. Candidate 37
**Overall Gap:** 1.95 (Human: 1.70, AI: 3.65)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clear hierarchy with a strong sans-serif used in multiple weights. The hero headline shows effective weight contrast and line breaks that emphasize key phrases; subtle gray for secondary lines improves hierarchy. Hand-drawn yellow marker accents around words add a distinct voice without hurting legibility. Body text and micro labels are generally consistent, and testimonial cards maintain readable sizes with proper leading. Minor issues: body copy in testimonials trends small, CTAs like 'Read more' feel under-scaled, and some lines in the hero are long which slightly reduces readability.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Overall structure is coherent: hero with portrait and decorative elements, followed by a clean 'I worked on…' section using large cards, then a testimonial grid and a simple logo strip. Spacing within cards and alignment to a consistent left column is solid, and shadows/rounded containers are handled tastefully. However, there are noticeable composition hiccups: a large, awkward gap between the second and third project cards with a partially visible next card creates a broken rhythm; one project preview uses a heavy fade/overlay that obscures content and looks misaligned; and some card CTAs are visually lightweight, reducing hierarchy within the cards.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Refined neutral palette (off‑white background, soft grays) with a restrained yellow accent (marker highlights, small star) that ties sections together. Subtle green/blue tints in project cards and gentle shadows add depth without clutter. Contrast between headline black and supporting gray is appropriate. Small knocks: the speckled/ confetti texture in the hero adds noise, and the desaturated overlay on one project card mutes clarity more than necessary.*

### 6. Candidate 11
**Overall Gap:** 1.90 (Human: 1.80, AI: 3.70)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is not terrible in the spacing, but it has some problems in terms of typesetting. A few examples in the navbar they use this all-caps, wide letter spacing design which is usually a bad sign. 

They then use a different outline for the selected tab that makes it look like a button instead of a selected tab, which confuses two patterns. 

They also selected a font that I think doesn't really work well at large sizes. It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, "Hello, I'm Hayley" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. 

There's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.

Using an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste. If we're going to make something really important in your site, it probably shouldn't be a default emoji. *

AI: *Clean, modern sans-serif with a consistent type scale. The hero headline is clearly heavier than the subhead, establishing hierarchy. Navigation labels in the top-right are compact and well-spaced, and footer headings ('Work', 'About') create a clear secondary level. Line lengths are comfortable and centered text is balanced. Minor knocks: the 'Let’s chat' link is visually under-emphasized (light weight and subtle color) and the footer link list feels a touch small with tight leading, slightly reducing readability.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is trying to be relatively minimal but it's not really working that well because:
- The navbar is super wide (takes up the whole width of the screen)
- The content of the body is very narrow
- The footer is wide again, but the footer is not as wide as the navbar
Inconsistent.

And then speaking of the footer, you'll notice that it's this very strange layout where the work section is really long and the about section is really short. This creates a lot of white space towards the right side. Work and about are top-aligned, but then the social icons are center-aligned. This inconsistency creates some ugly white space. *

AI: *Strong compositional discipline: a symmetrical, three-column square tile grid with consistent gutters; ample negative space around the grid creates a clear focal area. The vertical rhythm from hero > grid > footer is orderly, and alignment across sections is clean. Minor opportunities: the highly saturated project tiles overpower the relatively small hero, and the transition into the gray footer is abrupt, creating a slight visual weight jump.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The use of color here is fine. I think that keeping all the color in the middle is working well for her. And all the colors are sort of like a nice contrasting blue and red and various shades of it. So that's working fine.*

AI: *Neutral framework (white canvas, black text, light-gray footer) is stable, but overall color cohesion depends on the varied, saturated project thumbnails, causing a busy, mixed palette. The accent link color in the hero is subtle and risks low emphasis against the white background. While nothing feels jarring, the page lacks a clear, intentional primary/secondary color system beyond the thumbnail art.*

### 7. Candidate 13
**Overall Gap:** 1.75 (Human: 2.25, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *They used a pretty interesting serif here that I think is a sign that they have thought about this. The body also uses a relatively interesting looking model. But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. *

AI: *Clear hierarchy with a strong serif display for the hero headline ('User Researcher + Designer') that feels confident and well‑kerned. Secondary headings ('UNDERSTAND / ITERATE / REFINE') use a small, tracked sans that contrasts nicely with the headline. Link styling (teal, underlined) is consistent. However, the body copy beneath the hero and within the three columns appears too small and slightly tight in leading, creating a big jump from the very large hero to micro text with few intermediate sizes. Bulleted link lists feel dense, creating minor rhythm breaks.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.

So, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The "See my work" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. *

AI: *A clean three‑column grid with equal tiles, consistent gutters, and ample white space. The illustrations sit in uniform squares that align well to their respective text blocks, and the centered CTA button has generous breathing room. Overall balance is strong with left brand and right nav creating a stable header. Minor issues: the hero subcopy's narrow measure centered above a wide three‑column section introduces a small alignment tension, and the text blocks under each column feel a bit text‑heavy compared with the airy hero.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *They chose a pretty interesting pair of colors for the green and the yellow. I think it's actually quite good because of their complementarity*

AI: *Cohesive palette: deep teal for brand, links, and CTA outline; warm beige illustration panels; dark gray text on white background. The accents are used sparingly and consistently, giving a refined, editorial feel. Contrast is generally solid; the beige tiles are subtle against white, relying on teal linework for definition—tasteful but not especially bold.*

### 8. Candidate 54
**Overall Gap:** 1.55 (Human: 2.15, AI: 3.70)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clean sans-serif typography with clear hierarchy in the hero (large headline 'I am Jiyoung' contrasted with smaller intro copy). Alignment is disciplined and left‑ragged, supporting readability. Button label and nav use consistent sizing and weight. Minor issues: captions under thumbnails are very small and light gray on white, creating low contrast; the body copy in the dark hero is also slightly muted against the deep green, reducing legibility. No sophisticated type pairing or expressive scale beyond the hero keeps it from a 5.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout here is another example of really strange horizontal sizing between every section. So navbar and then the case studies are the same width, but then the hero section is super wide. *

AI: *Strong overall composition: balanced hero split with text on the left and a subtle dot‑grid animation on the right; generous negative space; consistent two‑column project grid with even gutters and tidy margins. Thumbnails sit on ample white space and shadows are restrained, giving depth without clutter. Small drawbacks: varying thumbnail aspect ratios introduce uneven vertical rhythm, and a few project tiles feel slightly misaligned in visual weight due to different framing/mocks, softening the grid’s precision.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The color here is a fine like just all monochrome. In fact, it's a little too monochrome. *

AI: *A restrained palette anchored by a deep green hero and white content areas creates a calm first impression. However, color system cohesion fades in the project grid where screenshots introduce many disparate colors, leading to visual noise. Accent usage is minimal and inconsistent, and some light gray text on white reduces contrast. Overall competent but not distinctive or tightly controlled.*

### 9. Candidate 3
**Overall Gap:** 1.50 (Human: 4.00, AI: 2.50)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The type usage here is again very minimal, there's only one size, but he's using color to differentiate things. The paragraph spacing and the line spacing look pretty good. Overall, not much is happening, but everything that is happening here is good. *

AI: *Clean, readable sans-serif (likely a system font such as SF/Inter) with generous line-height and comfortable measure (~65–75 chars). However, hierarchy is very limited: the name, paragraph text, and list items sit in a narrow size range with similar weights, producing a flat rhythm. Links use default blue with small external-link icons that add minor visual noise and don’t establish a refined link style (no custom underline/hover treatment visible). Overall competent but not expressive.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *Layout here is pretty good. Again, not doing much, but what it does, it does well. *

AI: *A restrained single-column layout with ample negative space and consistent left alignment. The three-column row (year / title / date) is tidy with hairline dividers and good alignment, suggesting attention to grid. That said, the overall composition is extremely simple and reads like a lightly styled document; there’s no strong focal hierarchy or visual cadence—just a text block followed by a sparse list—so it doesn’t demonstrate advanced compositional craft.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The color is not doing much here, but I think that the choices are here are relatively harmonious. They are clearly going after a default-looking feeling, preserving some of the blue link effect on the web, but they picked a slightly nicer shade of blue. The restraint and the color usage here is nice - it's like a three-shade. Overall, achieving a good minimalist effect without doing and flexing too much. *

AI: *Neutral palette: black/gray text on white with default-looking blue for links. Contrast appears adequate and the subtle gray for metadata is tasteful. Yet there’s no deliberate palette, accent system, or tonal layering beyond basics, making the page feel generic rather than crafted.*

**Red Flags:**
- Human: None

### 10. Candidate 52
**Overall Gap:** 1.35 (Human: 2.00, AI: 3.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Clear hierarchy driven by a bold, uppercase display headline with generous tracking over a textured hero creates a strong focal point. Navigation and section labels are clean and restrained. Captions under project thumbnails use consistent sizing and spacing, providing rhythm. Minor craft issues: body/caption text appears quite small and light gray, reducing readability/contrast; some micro-alignment in the captions (title vs. year) feels slightly loose.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *A tidy single-column grid with generous white space and consistent thumbnail widths gives order. The scrapbook-style project covers are well framed and generally aligned. However, the decorative patterned strip between hero and content introduces visual noise and breaks the otherwise minimal flow. The two-column footer ("Let's chat" and "Contact") feels under-aligned and light on spacing compared to the rest of the page, diminishing overall balance. Overall solid but not highly refined.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Distinct palette with deep maroon hero, olive/cream pattern, and muted paper textures provides personality. Hero text has strong contrast. Yet the maroon-to-olive transition is abrupt and slightly clashy, making the top feel heavy. Captions in low-contrast gray reduce clarity. The mixed hues in project collages occasionally compete with the brand colors, reducing cohesion.*

## Common AI Blindspots

**Sloppiness Blindness:**
- Occurred in 5 candidates: 11, 13, 31, 25

**Inconsistency Blindness:**
- Occurred in 3 candidates: 11, 29, 26

## Recommendations for Prompt Improvement

1. **Add explicit inconsistency detection:**
   - AI is missing width/alignment inconsistencies between sections
   - Add specific guidance about checking cross-section consistency

3. **Define 'sloppy' indicators:**
   - AI sees 'clean' where humans see 'sloppy'
   - List specific sloppy indicators: misaligned elements, inconsistent spacing, etc.
