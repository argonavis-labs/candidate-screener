## Top 10 Candidates with Largest Gaps

### 1. Candidate 13
**Overall Gap:** 1.75 (Human: 2.25, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 2.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *They used a pretty interesting serif here that I think is a sign that they have thought about this. The body also uses a relatively interesting looking model. But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. *

AI: *Distinct serif headline set very large creates a strong focal point (“User Researcher + Designer”) and pairs with a utilitarian sans for navigation, section labels, and body. Clear hierarchy through weight/size contrast and all‑caps section labels (“UNDERSTAND / ITERATE / REFINE”). Link styling in teal with underlines is consistent. Deducting a point for readability issues: body copy under the three cards appears quite small with relatively tight line-height and longish bullet lines, which makes the columns feel dense compared to the oversized H1.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 3.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.

So, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The "See my work" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. *

AI: *Clean, balanced composition using a simple grid. The hero centers the H1 with ample negative space, followed by a three-column row of equally sized illustration tiles aligned on a baseline. Spacing between logo (left) and nav (right) is intentional, and the CTA button is isolated beneath the grid, giving a clear scan path. Minor deductions: the microcopy columns are narrow and text-dense, creating visual heaviness compared to the otherwise airy layout; not particularly innovative beyond a solid grid.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *They chose a pretty interesting pair of colors for the green and the yellow. I think it's actually quite good because of their complementarity*

AI: *Restrained, harmonious palette: deep teal for brand (logo, links, bullets, CTA border) paired with warm sand backgrounds in the illustrations and neutral black/gray text. The cool–warm pairing adds character without noise, and accent color is applied consistently to interactive elements and highlights. No harsh shadows or clashing hues observed; overall cohesive, though not pushing into exceptional novelty.*

### 2. Candidate 11
**Overall Gap:** 1.20 (Human: 1.80, AI: 3.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The typography here is not terrible in the spacing, but it has some problems in terms of typesetting. A few examples in the navbar they use this all-caps, wide letter spacing design which is usually a bad sign. 

They then use a different outline for the selected tab that makes it look like a button instead of a selected tab, which confuses two patterns. 

They also selected a font that I think doesn't really work well at large sizes. It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, "Hello, I'm Hayley" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. 

There's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.

Using an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste. If we're going to make something really important in your site, it probably shouldn't be a default emoji. *

AI: *Clean, minimal system using a single sans-serif throughout. The hero has a clear H1 with small body copy, and nav/CTA use the same family with light letter-spacing. Hierarchy is serviceable but limited: only two real sizes are used and the footer links are almost the same treatment as body, reducing contrast. Centered hero copy is readable with reasonable line length, but the overall type system lacks a distinctive scale or character.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *The layout is trying to be relatively minimal but it's not really working that well because:
- The navbar is super wide (takes up the whole width of the screen)
- The content of the body is very narrow
- The footer is wide again, but the footer is not as wide as the navbar
Inconsistent.

And then speaking of the footer, you'll notice that it's this very strange layout where the work section is really long and the about section is really short. This creates a lot of white space towards the right side. Work and about are top-aligned, but then the social icons are center-aligned. This inconsistency creates some ugly white space. *

AI: *The 3x3 thumbnail grid is tidy with consistent gutters and equal square tiles, creating a strong central block and clear rhythm. White space around the grid is adequate and the page feels balanced. However, composition is fairly template-like: centered hero directly stacked over a uniform grid, then a full-bleed gray footer. The footer shift (full-width gray block with multi-column lists) feels disconnected from the tight center-aligned hero, breaking vertical rhythm and cohesion.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 3
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The use of color here is fine. I think that keeping all the color in the middle is working well for her. And all the colors are sort of like a nice contrasting blue and red and various shades of it. So that's working fine.*

AI: *The chrome is intentionally neutral (black/white with a light gray footer), letting project tiles carry the color. While this restraint is good, the nine tiles introduce many saturated hues with little cross-tile coordination, so the grid reads loud rather than harmonized. The teal 'Let’s chat' link introduces an extra accent not echoed elsewhere. Overall pleasant but not cohesive.*

**Red Flags:**
- Human: ['template_scent_high']
- AI: None

### 3. Candidate 1
**Overall Gap:** 0.35 (Human: 3.65, AI: 4.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *The type chooses a cool serif and it has a strong contrast with some of the small dates. It doesn't do much, but what it does, it does well. My one small feedback is that the work play contact section on the right doesn't seem as well done as the main text. But if you look at the main text, it's pretty good. *

AI: *Distinct editorial serif used at large display sizes creates a strong signature. Restraint is evident—primarily one type family in italic with a contrasting small sans serif for the vertical nav. Hierarchy is handled through color accents (blue for links) and subtle superscripts for dates, which shows micro-typographic care. Minor drawbacks: the entire paragraph set in italic reduces readability, and the line length is quite long for continuous reading, which slightly flattens hierarchy across lines.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 3
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

Human: *I think the layout is a little bit weak here. It doesn't do much, so I expect everything to be really good. But the work-play-contact section feels a little random and not super well-positioned with regard to everything else. *

AI: *Minimal, confident composition: a single large text block aligned left with generous negative space around it, producing clear focus. The slim, right-edge vertical nav provides a secondary axis without clutter. Spacing and margins feel consistent and intentional, with comfortable breathing room. Limited evidence beyond the hero prevents a higher score, and the long text measure could be tightened for better rhythm.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

Human: *This is generally pretty decent. On color usage, it uses one main color which is blue and then it carries it between the background and the highlight for the text. It's not super sophisticated, but what it does, it does decently well. *

AI: *Refined, restrained palette: soft light-grey background, near-black/dark blue body text, and a single vivid blue accent for links. Contrast is well balanced (avoids pure black), and the accent is used sparingly and purposefully, adding hierarchy without noise. With more surfaces/components demonstrated, this could approach fantastic.*

### 4. Candidate 10
**Overall Gap:** 0.35 (Human: 1.65, AI: 2.00)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Mixed serif body copy with sans-serif in nav, callout cards, and buttons without a clear system. Links use default-looking bright blue underlines that clash with the rest of the type. Headings don’t establish hierarchy—most sections are just paragraphs at the same size/weight, so the hero, bio, and education blocks read similarly. Bullet points are literal • characters with tight spacing, which feels unstyled. Overall reads as inconsistent and a bit dated rather than intentionally paired.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 1
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 1.0 (AI overrated)

AI: *Two-column pattern (text left, portrait/CTAs right) is clear but lacks refinement. The right-side cards appear at slightly different vertical positions and sizes, and don’t align with the portrait, breaking rhythm. Logos and badges are dropped into the text column, creating local clutter and uneven vertical rhythm. Section dividers are long thin lines that add separation but don’t resolve the underlying misalignment. Large white space is present, yet micro-spacing within blocks (bulleted list, card paddings) feels inconsistent.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 2
- AI Score: 2
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *Palette centers on blue, but there are several unrelated blues: bright default link blue, dark navy button, and pale blue card backgrounds. These hues don’t feel harmonized and create a disjointed accent system. Colored social icons at the footer introduce additional, unrelated colors that pull focus. Grey dividers are tasteful, but overall color usage lacks cohesion and subtlety.*

### 5. Candidate 12
**Overall Gap:** 0.30 (Human: 4.65, AI: 4.35)

**Per-Criteria Breakdown:**

**Typography:**
- Human Score: 4
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *A restrained sans-serif system (likely a single family) is used consistently across name, metadata, chat bubbles, and cards. Hierarchy is clear through weight, size, and tone: the name is bold and larger; secondary details are lighter; bubble text is uniform and readable. Line lengths are controlled by the bubble widths, preventing overly long measures. There’s tasteful contrast between bold headers and lighter meta text. Not a highly expressive or distinctive type pairing, but very clean and intentional with no random size jumps or alignment shifts.*

**Layout Composition:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 5
- Gap: 0.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *The chat-style composition is executed with strong rhythm and alignment. Bubbles follow a consistent grid with even vertical spacing, uniform pill radii, and clear conversational flow. Project cards are integrated seamlessly into the thread with matching corner radii, soft shadows, and balanced padding. The page has generous negative space and a centered column that maintains comfortable gutters on all sides. Visual weight is well managed—no competing focal points, and the eye moves naturally down the conversation.*

**Color:**
- Human Score: 5
- AI Score: 4
- Gap: 1.0 (AI underrated)

AI: *A cohesive, cool palette of desaturated blues and greys is used with restraint. Accent blue bubbles provide emphasis without overwhelming the page. Soft, diffused shadows and a subtle background gradient give depth while keeping contrast gentle. Color in the project imagery and social icons is contained within cards/buttons so it doesn’t fragment the palette. It’s polished and harmonious, though not pushing into particularly novel or complex color work.*

## Recommendations for Prompt Improvement

3. **Define 'sloppy' indicators:**
   - AI sees 'clean' where humans see 'sloppy'
   - List specific sloppy indicators: misaligned elements, inconsistent spacing, etc.

5. **General calibration adjustment:**
   - AI overrates 80% of portfolios
   - Consider adding guidance to be more critical overall
   - Emphasize looking for flaws before strengths
