The name and link accents in blue are clearly differentiated, and the small baseline-shifted year annotations show micro-typography care. Pairing with a neutral sans-serif for the right-rail nav provides hierarchy. However, setting the entire intro paragraph in italic with long line lengths slightly hurts readability and scannability, keeping it from a perfect score.",

The rotated right-side navigation ('Work | Play | Contact') adds a secondary axis without clutter. Elements feel intentional and balanced on the light gray canvas. Minor quibble: the small icon in the top-right floats somewhat disconnected from the text block, and the hero relies on a single focal element, giving limited structural depth.",

The serif/sans pairing (serif paragraphs, small sans-serif nav) gives some hierarchy, and the circular avatar caption-free area keeps copy uncluttered. However, hierarchy feels weak: the section headings like 'Let's connect' are nearly the same size as body text, and the nav labels are very small and low-contrast. Button labels inside the light-blue cards look cramped and slightly misaligned vertically within the buttons, and the mix of weights/casing across links and buttons appears inconsistent. Inline link styling uses default bright blue underlines that clash with other blue tones and feel unrefined.",

Thin horizontal rules create clear section breaks and there is ample negative space. Still, the composition lacks strong focal hierarchy\u2014no dominant headline or hero treatment\u2014and large pockets of empty space around the CTA cards make them feel like floating modules rather than anchored to the grid. Vertical spacing varies (e.g., distance from paragraphs to the adjacent cards vs. to the dividers), and the bottom 'Let's connect' section switches to centered alignment, breaking the established column rhythm.",

However, multiple unrelated blue shades appear (nav hover/active, inline link blue, card background, button blue), which reduces polish. The soft blue card with drop shadow reads slightly washed out compared to the saturated button, and the occasional non-system accent graphic introduces color noise.",

Footer headings ('Work', 'About') are bolder than the link lists, creating a readable hierarchy.

Micro-typography in the pill links (e.g., small separators and icons) is crisp and consistently styled. Alignment and spacing around text inside bubbles are even, with consistent padding.
