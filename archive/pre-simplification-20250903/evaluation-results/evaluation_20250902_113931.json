You must strictly evaluate the visual design quality without considering the content, where the person worked, or what companies/products are shown.\n\n## Evaluation Rules:\n\n1. **Score each dimension on a 1-5 scale** using the provided rubric anchors:\n   - 1: Terrible\n   - 2: Below average\n   - 3: Average\n   - 4: Above average\n   - 5: Fantastic\n\n2. **For each dimension, you MUST:**\n   - Provide a score (1-5)\n   - Write a detailed explanation of WHY you gave that score\n   - Cite specific visual evidence (e.g., \"inconsistent spacing between sections\", \"serif/sans-serif pairing creates strong hierarchy\")\n   - Rate your confidence in the score (1-5 scale where 1=very uncertain, 5=very confident)\n\n3. **Avoid context bias:**\n   - DO NOT be influenced by company names, logos, or prestigious brands shown\n   - DO NOT consider the actual content/copy of case studies\n   - DO NOT factor in where the person worked or what they worked on\n   - Focus ONLY on the visual execution and design craft\n\n4. **Be consistent in your evaluations:**\n   - Apply the rubric standards strictly and consistently across all evaluations\n   - Use the full 1-5 rating scale when warranted\n\n5. **Check for red flags** and list them if present:\n   - template_scent_high\n   - sloppy_images\n   - process_soup\n\n## Output Format:\n\nReturn **only** valid JSON matching this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": \"X\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"typography\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"layout_composition\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\", \n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    }\n  },\n  \"red_flags\": [\"list any that apply\"],\n  \"overall_weighted_score\": calculated_number,\n  \"overall_confidence\": calculated_number\n}\n```\n\n## Scoring Calculation:\n- base_score = (typography \u00d7 0.35) + (layout_composition \u00d7 0.35) + (color \u00d7 0.30)\n- penalty = sum of red flag penalties:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.5 points\n  - sloppy_images: 0.3 points\n  - process_soup: 0.2 points\n- overall_weighted_score = base_score - penalty  // scores can go below 0\n- overall_confidence = average of individual dimension confidences\n\n\n# RUBRIC (authoritative)\n\nThe rubric is the primary guide.

Uses what appears to be a serif typeface (possibly a premium font) for the main content with excellent hierarchy created through strategic use of color (blue for name and current company) rather than relying on size variations. The italic styling is used purposefully to create emphasis and flow. Line spacing and rhythm appear well-considered, with good readability. The combination of serif body text with clean sans-serif navigation elements (visible on right side) shows thoughtful contrast. However, some of the body text sizing appears slightly large which prevents this from being a perfect 5.",

The centered layout with generous margins creates a sophisticated, editorial feel. The asymmetrical placement of text within the large white space shows confidence in layout decisions. Navigation elements are cleanly positioned vertically on the right edge, showing systematic thinking. The overall composition feels intentional rather than default-centered, with good understanding of visual weight and balance.

The gutters and spacing appear inconsistent - some project cards have tighter spacing while others are more generous. The screenshots within each colored background are presented inconsistently - some are single large images, others show multiple device mockups. The alternating left-right text placement creates some visual interest but the lack of a cohesive color or spacing system makes the overall composition feel disjointed and random rather than intentionally varied.",

          "score": 2,
          "explanation": "The color usage is problematic with too many unrelated colors that lack a cohesive throughline. The site uses bright yellow, blue, orange, purple, green, pink, and teal backgrounds for different projects with no apparent color relationship or intentional contrast strategy. These colors appear to be chosen randomly rather than forming a harmonious palette. While each individual color section is executed cleanly, the overall effect is visually chaotic. The colors don't share complementary relationships or intentional similarity, violating the principle of using 'few colours with restraint in ways that are meaningful to the design.' The monochromatic header and footer sections are well-executed, but this restraint doesn't carry through to the project showcase area.",

          "explanation": "The portfolio demonstrates strong typographic restraint and hierarchy. Uses what appears to be a single typeface family with intentional weight variations to create clear information architecture. The large hero text is well-proportioned and creates strong visual impact. Project titles and descriptions maintain consistent styling with appropriate size relationships. Line spacing appears well-considered throughout. However, some body text sections could benefit from slightly more refined line-height optimization, and the overall system could push further into sophisticated territory.",

          "score": 3,
          "explanation": "The layout follows a clean, center-aligned approach with consistent structure across project sections. White space is used effectively around the hero section and between projects. Each project presentation follows a similar pattern with title, description, and visual mockup. However, the composition feels somewhat template-like with predictable spacing patterns. The project mockups are reasonably presented but lack creative layout innovation - they rely heavily on standard device mockups without much visual connection between different project presentations. The overall grid system is sound but doesn't demonstrate exceptional compositional thinking.",

        "color": {
          "score": 3,
          "explanation": "The portfolio employs a restrained monochromatic approach with selective use of a coral/orange accent color in the header logo and navigation. The grey backgrounds for project sections provide subtle separation. This minimal approach shows discipline, but the execution doesn't demonstrate sophisticated color mastery. The grey tones appear somewhat flat without intentional variation in hue or saturation. The accent color is used sparingly but could be more strategically deployed to enhance hierarchy. While the restraint is appropriate, it doesn't push into territory of exceptional color craft.",
