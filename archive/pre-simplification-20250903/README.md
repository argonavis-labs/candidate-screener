# Pre-Simplification Archive (September 3, 2024)

This archive contains all the results and data from before the major simplification of the continuous improvement system.

## What's Archived:

### `evaluation-results/`
- All evaluation runs from the complex system
- Timestamped JSON files with full metadata
- Results from various prompt versions and iterations

### `prompt-improvement-reports/` 
- Gap analysis reports from the old complex system (report_v1_iter1.md through report_v14_iter2.md)
- These reports showed repetitive recommendations due to system limitations

### `prompt-versions/`
- All prompt versions generated by the old system (prompt_v1.md through prompt_v15.md)
- Version manifest tracking system
- Many versions had accumulated "junk" from repeated modifications

### `continuous_prompt_improvement_old.py`
- The original complex implementation with JSON parsing, text replacement, and version management
- Had issues with truncated context, repetitive recommendations, and complex state management

### `ai-ratings.json`
- Symlink to the latest evaluation results from the old system

## System Changes Made:

1. **Simplified continuous improvement loop** - removed complex JSON parsing and text replacement
2. **Full context improvement** - sends complete prompt instead of truncated 800 chars
3. **Visual context** - includes problem candidate images in improvement requests  
4. **Clean prompt rewriting** - asks for complete rewritten prompts instead of incremental changes
5. **Parallel evaluation** - added ThreadPoolExecutor with retry logic and rate limit monitoring
6. **Consolidated prompt structure** - moved from multi-file assembly to single prompt.md

## Fresh Start:

The new system starts with:
- `prompt.md` as single source of truth
- Clean evaluation results directory
- Simplified improvement reports in `gap_reports/`
- Clean prompt versions without accumulated modifications
