Judge only what is visible in the provided page(s)/images. Do not infer quality from brands, content, or reputation.\n\n## Evaluation Rules\n\n1. Scoring posture (critical but calibrated to visible craft):\n   - Default anchor is 3 (Average/Competent). Start each dimension at 3 only when the work is readable and basically organized. Move up or down strictly on visible evidence.\n   - Before moving above 3, scan for issues and weigh severity:\n     - Hunt for at least 3 concrete issues. Only hold at 2\u20133 when issues are systemic (repeat, affect readability/rhythm, or break cohesion). Isolated, low\u2011impact nits should not block a 4.\n   - \u201cClean but generic\u201d is not \u201cstrong.\u201d Default\u2011ish type, boilerplate layouts, or lightly styled templates should land at 2\u20133 unless you see clear bespoke tuning and micro\u2011craft (see Rule 2).\n   - Do not award 4\u20135 for \u201cnot broken.\u201d Scores 4\u20135 require sustained refinement across multiple sections and/or a distinctive, coherent POV that improves clarity and cohesion.\n   - Evidence\u2011limited views: When only a single hero or single section is visible, cap each dimension at 3 unless the Minimalism Micro\u2011Craft Check or the Elevated Basics Check passes (see Rule 2). You may award 4 on a single refined view when checks pass even if hover/state evidence is not visible but consistency is strongly implied by repetition and coherence. Never award 5 without multiple sections unless the visible view shows unmistakable master\u2011level micro\u2011craft.\n   - Apply caps from red flags (Rules 7 and 9). If template scent is strong without counter\u2011evidence, cap Typography and Layout at 3. If sloppy image cues \u22653, cap Layout at 2 and consider Color 2 when mismatched whites/mats cause flicker. If both template_scent_high and sloppy_images are present, hold Layout at 2 max and be conservative elsewhere.\n   - Expected distribution guidance (not a hard rule): most competent but generic work should end at 3; 2s are common for visible sloppiness or uncustomized templates; 4s are uncommon and require visible refinement; 5s are rare.\n\n2. Two ways a single refined view can justify a 4 (tightened signals; reduce false leniency and false strictness):\n   - Minimalism Micro\u2011Craft Check (pass when \u22655 signals are present and NO disqualifiers):\n     - Tuned neutrals (off\u2011black/off\u2011white; borders/shadows with gentle hue shifts and controlled values).\n     - Customized link styling or convincingly tuned defaults (non\u2011default hue OR adjusted underline thickness/offset; consistent treatment across multiple links; hover/state not required if consistency is evident).\n     - Measured typographic rhythm (predictable scale steps; stable baseline; no widows/orphans; intentional hyphenation and rags; consistent punctuation and casing by role).\n     - Intentional spacing system (e.g., 4/8/12 multiples; even row rhythm; no accidental half\u2011gutter gaps).\n     - Optical alignment corrections (icons aligned to x\u2011height/caps; bullets/dividers centered optically; numerals/symbols sit correctly).\n     - Hierarchy achieved with minimal styles (tone/weight/spacing) yet unambiguous; label/meta styles repeat exactly.\n     - Disciplined image/list presentation (matching aspect ratios, radii, mats, caption positions; screenshots readable; no emoji bullets or novelty icons used as structure).\n     - Cohesive bespoke touches (e.g., editorial serif paired with care; caret/arrow/external\u2011link glyph alignment to cap height; button strokes matching surrounding type weight; no default blue + default underline combo).\n     - Verification note for minimal lists: treat proper\u2011noun capitalization differences as acceptable when the role style is otherwise consistent; do not infer inconsistency from brand/title case exceptions without multiple conflicting instances in the same role.\n   - Elevated Basics Check (for default\u2011leaning but carefully tuned designs; pass when \u22656 signals are present and NO disqualifiers):\n     - Comfortable measures (55\u201375ch body preferred; 45\u201380ch acceptable) and consistent 1.35\u20131.65 leading; display leading tighter but non\u2011colliding.\n     - Consistent link treatment even if conservative; underline weight/offset intentional; hue is slightly softened or harmonized with the shell (not pure default unless clearly intentional and tuned elsewhere).\n     - Neutrals feel considered (soft grey dividers, off\u2011black text); no harsh pure #000/#fff pairs; shadows/borders with subtle tints.\n     - Repetition handled with discipline (long card/icon grids keep identical mats, radii, border weights, caption rhythm).\n     - Clear text scale system repeated across sections; punctuation/quotes consistent; no random bolding to simulate hierarchy.\n     - Accents are sparse and role\u2011clear; imagery carries color without clashing; mats/borders unify diverse screenshots.\n     - No sloppy artifacts (no jaggies/compression; crops and radii match; consistent shadow/border logic; screenshots readable; device frames avoided or customized with readable content).\n   - Disqualifiers for both checks (any one present fails the check and caps the dimension at 3 max; two or more disqualifiers should pull to 2):\n     - Inconsistent casing within the same role (e.g., H2s switching between Title Case and sentence case within the same set of H2s).\n     - Emoji or novelty icons used as bullets causing irregular indents/line heights.\n     - Random tracking/over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; monospace or \u201ccode\u201d face used for body copy; button text uses a different font from body or stroke weight mismatches adjacent type.\n     - Oversized personal nameplate/logotype in the nav competing with hero/title.\n     - Perceived container\u2011width drift (e.g., wide nav, narrow hero rag, wide body) without rationale; floaty outline CTA not tied to grid.\n     - Unreadable screenshots or device frames with tiny UI; visible cut\u2011off crops; angled phone mocks mixed with flat browser tiles that reduce readability.\n\n3. Score each dimension on a 1\u20135 scale (be conservative but fair):\n   - 1: Poor\n   - 2: Below average\n   - 3: Average (competent baseline; default outcome)\n   - 4: Strong (refined and intentional; passes Rule 2 or shows sustained quality across multiple sections)\n   - 5: Exceptional (rare, masterful, original, and controlled across multiple sections)\n\n4. For each dimension, you MUST:\n   - Provide a score (1\u20135).\n   - Write a concise explanation citing at least 3 concrete visual observations (e.g., \u201cbullets over\u2011indented by ~2\u20133ch,\u201d \u201cmasonry gutters uneven; left column bottoms don\u2019t align,\u201d \u201cnav nameplate overscales body by ~1.7\u00d7,\u201d \u201cdefault link blue with default underline,\u201d \u201cstatus bars cut off,\u201d \u201ccenter/left alignment alternates without grid reason,\u201d \u201cvertical gaps in zigzag < horizontal gaps, causing awkward voids\u201d).\n   - Call out at least one limitation, even for scores \u22654, to avoid uncritical praise. Distinguish minor nitpicks from systemic issues.\n   - If you apply a red flag, list at least two matching cues and state the cap you applied.\n   - Rate your confidence (1\u20135). If evidence is partial (e.g., only a hero or one section), set confidence \u22643 unless a check in Rule 2 clearly passes, in which case confidence can be 3\u20134 if repetition supports it.\n\n5. Avoid context bias:\n   - Ignore brands, company names, and content substance.\n   - Evaluate only visible visual execution and design craft.\n\n6. Calibration and exemplars:\n   - Use exemplar ratings as calibration anchors.\n   - Apply the same standard across evaluations. Minimal, text\u2011forward pages can earn 4 when micro\u2011craft is clearly elevated (see Rule 2), especially when long, repeated lists or grids show flawless rhythm/alignment. A single, well\u2011crafted serif/sans with tuned blue links and disciplined spacing can qualify for 4 even if the palette is intentionally restrained.\n   - Considered variation is allowed. Collage or gallery layouts can be strong when gutters, captions, and optical alignment repeat exactly. Penalize sloppy inconsistency, not deliberate variation.\n\n7. Red flags (detect and list explicitly; precise thresholds):\n   - Only flag when BOTH are true:\n     - Count threshold met:\n       - template_scent_high: \u22653 cues with at least 1 structural cue.\n       - sloppy_images: \u22652 image\u2011quality cues that harm readability/rhythm (see Rule 9). Layout variety alone does not qualify.\n       - process_soup: \u22652 cues overshadowing final visuals.\n     - Severity is clear in the provided view(s) (point to exact areas).\n   - When uncertain, do not flag; lower scores and reduce confidence instead. Do not flag solely for a typical stack of modules if bespoke tuning is evident (consistent mats, tuned neutrals, customized links, optical alignment).\n\n8. Innovation vs basic competence:\n   - Do not award 4\u20135 for centered heroes, uniform card grids, outline \u201cVIEW PROJECT\u201d buttons, device\u2011mock rows, or logo bands if they read boilerplate or default. \u201cLooks fine\u201d is a 3.\n   - Reward originality only when it improves comprehension and is executed with control (alignment, rhythm, hierarchy, and color remain strong). Textures/illustrations and collage elements must support clarity; ornamental panels that spike value or reduce readability should pull scores down.\n\n9. Quick template/sloppiness scan (use to inform red flags and to avoid overrating):\n   - Template scent cues (3+ suggests template_scent_high; cap Typography/Layout at 3 unless strong counter\u2011evidence exists). Require at least 1 structural cue:\n     - Structural cues:\n       - Stock hero patterns: \u201cHello, I\u2019m [Name]\u201d headline; down\u2011arrow \u201cSee projects\u201d; narrow centered hero between wider nav/body; left/right zigzag rows; alternating banded sections; grid of identical cards with outline CTAs; \u201cLike what you see?\u201d CTA inserted as a card in a project zigzag; logo\u2011marquee bands as filler; boilerplate footer; \u201cMade with Framer/Webflow\u201d badge.\n       - Unexplained switches between center and left alignment mirroring theme defaults; container\u2011width drift across sections (nav full\u2011width \u2192 narrow hero \u2192 wide body).\n     - Styling cues:\n       - Copy\u2011paste UI\u2011kit tokens: identical 12/16px radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues/purples; Inter/Roboto link blue with default underline/visited purple.\n       - Notion/Figma\u2011style blocks with unmodified toggles/dividers; generic device frames; cookie\u2011cutter badges/pills with identical shadows; doodles/handwriting stickers next to default UI.\n       - Billboard background words as filler; oversized personal nameplate competing with hero/title; outline CTAs floating off\u2011grid.\n     - Important: Do not flag solely for a centered hero + grid if bespoke tuning is evident (consistent mats, tuned neutrals, customized links or tuned default link, optical alignment). Require 3+ cues, including \u22651 structural.\n   - Sloppy execution cues (2+ suggests sloppy_images; if 3+ present, cap Layout at 2 and consider Color 2 when mats/whites flicker):\n     - Image readability/quality: screenshots too small/zoomed out to read; device frames with tiny UI; aliasing/jaggies; compression or non\u2011retina blur; status bars cut off; visible crop cut\u2011offs; letterforms cropped by section edges; angled phone renders mixed with flat browser tiles causing tiny, hard\u2011to\u2011read content.\n     - Presentation consistency: inconsistent crops/aspects; mixed or mismatched corner radii; shadow/border values fluctuate without logic; thick/variable internal mats; captions misaligned to tiles; stray 1\u20132px misalignments repeated; pixel wobble across grids.\n     - Rhythm coherence: irregular masonry gutters; vertical vs horizontal gaps unbalanced in zigzag rows; mixed device photos alongside UI tiles that break cohesion; full\u2011color social/client logos used as tiles without harmonization; mixed pastel/bright thumbnail mats within the same grid that create value flicker due to lack of a unifying frame.\n   - Process soup cues:\n     - Walls of sticky notes, personas, or unreadable timelines dominating above final visuals; deliverables with tiny text that cannot be evaluated; little or no polished product shots.\n\n10. Execution checklists before scoring (aim to catch common misses and reduce both leniency and underrating):\n\n   - Typography:\n     - Casing consistency by role: verify sentence vs Title Case rules for the SAME element type (H1/H2/nav labels/meta). Role\u2011level mismatches are a deduction (repeated across sections pulls to 2). Treat brand/proper\u2011noun capitalization as acceptable within a consistent role style.\n     - Nameplate sizing: personal name/logotype in nav should not visually dominate hero/title; if it competes (>~1.4\u00d7 body scale or dominant weight), deduct (repeated \u2192 pull to 2).\n     - Bullets and lists: check indent alignment and line\u2011height; over\u2011indented bullets or emoji/typed \u201c\u2022\u201d that create irregular indents reduce score (repeated \u2192 cap at 2).\n     - Tracking/weight: penalize over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; \u201ceverything bold\u201d; random word\u2011level bolding to fake hierarchy.\n     - Link treatment: hue, underline thickness/offset, visited/hover cues; penalize the exact default combination (pure #0a66ff\u2011like blue + default underline) when it reads unmodified. If hue/underline are tuned and consistent, do not over\u2011penalize minimalism.\n     - Pairing logic: avoid editorial/display or monospace used for body; detect mixed fonts in buttons vs body; ensure button stroke weights match type weight.\n     - Measure/leading: confirm body 55\u201375ch preferred (45\u201380ch acceptable); leading 1.35\u20131.65; display lines long (>~90\u2013100ch) are risky\u2014deduct unless optical spacing clearly compensates; right\u2011aligned body paragraphs in a hero are risky\u2014deduct unless clearly justified and impeccably spaced; uneven rags in narrow heroes suggesting different container widths are a deduction.\n     - Spacing rhythm: check separation between headings, labels, and body; labels so small that gaps read oversized should prompt deductions.\n\n   - Layout & Composition:\n     - Grid/gutter consistency; spacing system in 4/8/12 multiples. Look for real and perceived width drift: wide nav \u2192 narrow hero rag \u2192 wide body (or perceived drift from short hero lines). Penalize both when they read as different container widths without rationale.\n     - Alignment discipline: avoid unjustified center/left switches; detect edge/rag drift; note floaty outline CTAs; ensure captions and buttons align to the grid; align bottoms in paired tiles; ensure repeated \u201cVIEW\u201d buttons sit in the same position and follow the grid.\n     - Zigzag rows: verify cross\u2011axis balance; when vertical gaps are noticeably smaller than horizontal, or when a non\u2011project CTA is inserted into a project zigzag without its own section/wrapper, deduct for rhythm incoherence (template cue).\n     - Image framing: mats, border weights, corner radii; detect generic device mocks and unreadable screenshots; check for cut\u2011off crops and letterforms cropped by panels.\n     - Repetition: identical caption positions and offsets; consistent tile aspect ratios; beware irregular masonry or collage with flickering whitespace; penalize mixed device frames alongside UI tiles when they break rhythm.\n\n   - Color:\n     - Palette quality: tuned neutrals vs harsh #000/#fff; accent role clarity and consistency; link/CTA state logic (states may be implied by consistent usage when not visibly shown).\n     - Unification tactics: mats/borders/shadow tints that harmonize diverse imagery; avoid bright footers or tiles that jump in value and break the system; textured/illustrated bands must not dominate or spike value.\n     - Penalize noisy additions: full\u2011color social/client logos in minimal shells; colored outlines around icons/logos; pastel mats that fail to tame saturated UI; billboard color panels that spike value without clear purpose.\n     - Gallery exception: when the page is an intentionally neutral shell presenting varied artwork/tiles, judge color primarily by the chrome (neutrals, mats, borders, caption color). Do not penalize the artwork\u2019s inherent color variety if the frame system keeps value calm and consistent.\n     - Minimalist allowance: a single tuned blue accent (slightly softened or hue\u2011shifted from defaults) used consistently can merit a 4 when neutrals and value steps are disciplined and imagery is well contained.\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn only valid JSON matching this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": \"X\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"typography\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"layout_composition\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    }\n  },\n  \"red_flags\": [\"list any that apply\"],\n  \"overall_weighted_score\": calculated_number,\n  \"overall_confidence\": calculated_number\n}\n```\n\n## Scoring Calculation\n- base_score = (typography \u00d7 0.35) + (layout_composition \u00d7 0.35) + (color \u00d7 0.30)\n- penalty = sum of red flag penalties:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.6 points\n  - sloppy_images: 0.6 points\n  - process_soup: 0.25 points\n- overall_weighted_score = base_score - penalty\n- overall_confidence = average of individual dimension confidences\n\n---\n\n## RUBRIC\n\nUse the full 1\u20135 range. The \u201cScore 3\u201d rows define the competent baseline. Default to 3 when evidence is mixed, default\u2011ish, or generic. Use 4\u20135 only when criteria are clearly met across multiple sections, or when a single view passes Rule 2. Round down when sloppy cues or template scent appear; avoid red\u2011flagging unless thresholds are met. Do not underrate minimal but carefully tuned execution\u2014reward disciplined restraint.\n\n## Typography (Weight: 35%)\n\nExamine closely (cite specifics):\n- Typeface quality (pro\u2011grade vs overused free), appropriateness, and pairing logic.\n- Hierarchy via scale ratios, weight, spacing, tone\u2014not only bolding.\n- Readability: body 55\u201375ch preferred; line\u2011height 1.35\u20131.65; display tighter leading without collisions.\n- Consistency: heading levels, list styles, link treatment (underline thickness/offset), baseline rhythm, quote punctuation and apostrophes, superscripts/subscripts alignment, casing/capitalization patterns by role.\n- Micro\u2011craft: optical kerning for all\u2011caps; punctuation spacing; small\u2011caps quality; number alignment; hyphenation/rag control; external\u2011link glyph alignment.\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Minimal style set yields rich, unmistakable hierarchy with impeccable rhythm across sections.\n- Pairing (or single family) shows mastery; details tuned (optical alignment, kerning, consistent cap/ascender spacing; intentional hyphenation; no widows/orphans; bullets align; lists indent cleanly).\n- Distinct typographic voice that feels bespoke yet highly readable. Link/label systems are rigorously consistent, including states and edge cases.\n- Masterful long grids or text\u2011forward pages can earn 5 even without visible link states when every other micro\u2011detail is flawless across many sections.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Clear hierarchy with restrained, consistent styles; comfortable measures and leading across sections or a single refined view that passes Rule 2.\n- Evident scale system across elements; link styling is customized or tuned and consistent (underline weight/offset intentional; hue harmonized).\n- Elevated basics allowed: a common system sans or an editorial serif can earn 4 when rhythm, measures, punctuation, casing BY ROLE, and link treatment are disciplined and repeat.\n- Minor issues only (e.g., one slightly hot link hue, a tight display line, a narrow rag).\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline (default)\n- Readable with adequate hierarchy and a limited style set; may feel generic.\n- Choices can be default\u2011ish (system sans + near\u2011default link blue) but aren\u2019t broken.\n- Light inconsistencies: heading levels close in size; occasional baseline drift; a widow/orphan; casing differences across different sections but not within the same role.\n\nScore 2: Below average\n- Multiple issues that reduce polish and clarity:\n  - Inconsistent capitalization/casing within the same element role; \u201ceverything bold\u201d; random word\u2011level bolding.\n  - Bullets over\u2011indented or emoji/typed bullets creating irregular indents/line height.\n  - Random tracking/over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; editorial/display or monospace used for body; mixed font in CTAs/buttons vs body; button stroke weight not matching adjacent text weight.\n  - Link styling clearly default with thick default underline; mixed link treatments; no visible or implied state logic.\n  - Repeated widows/orphans, sloppy rags, unstable baselines across sections.\n  - Oversized personal nameplate/logotype competing with the main title; right\u2011aligned body text in the hero causing awkward rags; missing spacing between headings/labels and body.\n- Voice reads generic or junior despite basic legibility.\n\nScore 1: Poor\n- Flat or confusing hierarchy; style proliferation; unreadable measures (very long/very tight lines, e.g., hero ~90\u2013100ch); collisions/overlaps; broken lists/labels; inconsistent quotes/apostrophes throughout.\n\nNegative indicators that should pull to 2 (or 1 when frequent):\n- Default link blue with default underline; pervasive casing inconsistency by role; over\u2011indented bullets; visible reflow collisions; mismatched button font or outline weight; oversized personal nameplate; arbitrary tracking; right\u2011aligned hero body without strong typographic control.\n\nRefined minimal vs generic minimal:\n- Refined: tuned neutrals; customized or tuned underline weight/offset; disciplined scale steps; stable baselines; optical alignment of icons/marks; consistent micro\u2011labels and dates; intentional hyphenation; bullets align with text blocks; role\u2011consistent casing.\n- Generic: pure default link blue with default underline; uneven paragraph spacing; arbitrary size jumps; mixed alignment without rationale; unmodified Notion export vibes; over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; nav/hero sizing competition.\n\n## Layout & Composition (Weight: 35%)\n\nExamine:\n- Grid usage: columns, gutters, container widths; spacing system (multiples of 4/8/12).\n- Structural clarity: section breaks, scan patterns, focal points, navigation affordances.\n- Image presentation: consistent crops, device\u2011frame consistency or bespoke mats; matching radii/border weights/shadows; readable screenshots.\n- Innovation with control: novel structures that aid comprehension; restraint that still shows a point of view.\n- Breadth of evidence: multiple sections vs single hero; consistency across the page and visible breakpoints.\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Masterful structure with a clear POV that elevates clarity (inventive yet disciplined layouts; precise orchestration across columns/sections).\n- Immaculate rhythm and alignment across breakpoints; optical fixes for asymmetric content; complex, long grids remain perfectly in sync.\n- Assets are harmonized (radii, borders, shadows, captions) with flawless consistency across diverse content.

Penalize ornament (tape/paper textures, stripes) when it distracts from content or breaks value rhythm.\n- Minimalist allowance: a single, well\u2011chosen accent used sparingly and consistently can justify a 4 when the shell\u2019s value discipline is evident.\n\n---",

The name and one company are styled as blue links (no default underline), giving a clear, consistent link treatment. Superscripted years with proper en dashes are precisely aligned and repeat consistently (e.g., 2022\u2013, 2019\u20132022), a sign of micro\u2011craft. Line height is comfortable and there are no widows/orphans in the hero paragraph. Minor issues: the full paragraph in high\u2011contrast italics can be fatiguing for longer reading; line length feels slightly long for display copy; the tiny rotated side\u2011nav labels are a bit small/low\u2011contrast compared with the hero.",
