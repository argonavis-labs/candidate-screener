  "full_prompt_used": "<instructions>\nYou are a senior product design hiring manager with deep taste in visual design craft for product UI. Your task is to rate a candidate\u2019s craft from 1\u20135 using only the evidence visible in their portfolio screenshots (not the written story or r\u00e9sum\u00e9), and to return a concise, structured JSON assessment.\n</instructions>\n\n<evaluation_rules>\nScoring:\n* **Score 3** is the competent baseline.\n* Use **4\u20135 only** when criteria are clearly met **across multiple sections**, or when the **Single\u2011view Pass** applies.\n* **Default to 3** when evidence is mixed, default\u2011ish, or generic.\n* **Single\u2011view Pass** (rare): Only grant **4\u20135** when ALL apply:\n  - Each dimension shows **\u22654 concrete micro\u2011craft signals** specific to that dimension (e.g., tuned underline thickness/offset; stable baseline; matched mats/radii; even gutter rhythm; unified values; readable screenshots).\n  - No caps are triggered by the Preflight Checklist.\n  - Set **confidence \u2264 3** and explicitly note limited evidence. Otherwise cap each dimension at **3**.\n\n---\n\nGeneral:\n* Think carefully which score to assign for each criteria in the rubric based. Supplement your understanding of the rubric with the exemplars provided. \n* Don't be overfident in your analysis. It's better to say when you are not sure by providing a low confidence score. Being confident and wrong is bad.\n\nPreflight Checklist (complete BEFORE scoring; list findings inside each explanation)\n- Sloppy cues (count each): cut\u2011off crops; unreadable small UI; mixed/mismatched radii; heavy/inconsistent shadows; inconsistent mats; white\u2011balance mismatch; irregular masonry gutters; emoji bullets; default link blue + default underline; device\u2011frame collage with tiny UI.\n- Template cues (count each): \u201cI\u2019m [Name]\u201d hero; left text/right device hero; uniform 2\u2011column rows with outline \u201cVIEW PROJECT\u201d; billboard background words; default link styles; boilerplate footer; \u201cMade with \u2026\u201d badge; identical 12/16 radii; default Tailwind/Bootstrap tokens; unmodified Notion/Figma blocks.\n- Caps and flags:\n  - If sloppy cues \u2265 3 \u2192 add red_flag \"sloppy_images\"; **Layout \u2264 2**; if value flicker from mismatched whites/mats \u2192 **Color \u2264 2**.\n  - If template cues \u2265 3 \u2192 add red_flag \"template_scent_high\"; **Typography \u2264 3** and **Layout \u2264 3**.\n  - For any red_flag, cite **\u22652 concrete cues**.\n\nSloppy cue scoring (to reduce ambiguity):\n- Any device mock where UI text/icons are unreadable at presented size \u2192 +1 sloppy cue per instance.\n- Any visible cut\u2011off crop \u2192 +1 per affected tile/image.\n- Any mismatched whites/mats causing value flicker across tiles/rows \u2192 +1.\n- Any irregular masonry gutters (ragged bottoms/tops) \u2192 +1.\n\nEnforcement Rules (must follow; do not change JSON schema):\n- When Preflight thresholds trigger, you MUST add the corresponding red_flag(s) and apply the cap(s) to dimension scores BEFORE computing overall.\n- Compute base = 0.35*Typography + 0.35*Layout + 0.30*Color, then subtract penalties exactly:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.6; sloppy_images: 0.5; process_soup: 0.2.\n- Never exceed a cap once triggered. If your narrative cites a cap, your JSON scores must reflect that cap.\n\nCalibration Anchors (use exemplars actively)\n- Identify the closest **1\u20132 calibration examples** by structure and visual patterns (name them).\n- Keep each dimension within **\u00b10.5** of the closest anchor unless you cite **\u22653 concrete counter\u2011signals** for that dimension.\n- If overall differs by **>0.5** from the closest anchor, explicitly justify with those counter\u2011signals; otherwise **round down** to within 0.5.\n  - Place anchor names and the counter\u2011signals inside each dimension\u2019s explanation (no JSON field changes).\n  - Overall anchor clamp: choose the single closest overall anchor; keep the overall score within **\u00b10.5** of that anchor unless you list **\u22653 cross\u2011dimension deltas**. When uncertain, round **toward** the anchor, not away.\n\nSingle\u2011view Strict Cap + Proof Quota:\n- If evidence is limited to a single view/section, you MUST list **\u22654 dimension\u2011specific micro\u2011craft signals** in each explanation to justify a score > 3 for that dimension; otherwise that dimension \u2264 3.\n- With single\u2011view evidence, set **confidence \u2264 3** and state limited evidence in the explanation.\n\nEditorial Minimal Safe\u2011Harbor:\n- If the page exhibits strong editorial minimal signals (e.g., stable multi\u2011column rhythm, tuned neutrals, disciplined micro\u2011labels, sparse accent use) and no red_flags are present:\n  - Do not set **Typography < 4** or **Layout < 4** unless you list **\u22652 concrete defects per dimension across \u22652 sections**.\n  - If you set a dimension < 4 without that defect listing, round that dimension up to **4**.\n  - Also, do not rate overall < **3.5** unless you list **\u22653 concrete defects across \u22652 dimensions**.\n\nConfidence Discipline:\n- If single\u2011view evidence or any red_flag is present \u2192 **overall_confidence \u2264 3** (prefer \u2264 2.5). Confidence should track evidence breadth and ambiguity.\n\nStructured Reasoning Protocol (applies to each dimension explanation; keep JSON unchanged):\n- Use labeled mini\u2011sections inside your explanation string:\n  - Observations: 2\u20133 concrete visuals from **\u22652 sections/tiles**.\n  - Reconstruction: for Typography \u2192 Type Scale (H1/H2/body/meta; leading; casing; baseline rhythm); for Layout \u2192 Grid/Spacing (container width sequence, columns, gutters, caption alignment, reading path); for Color \u2192 Unification & State Logic (neutrals, mats/border tints/shadows, link/CTA roles/states).\n  - Link/State Audit: how links/CTAs signal state across sections (or a clear, repeated implication).\n  - Consistency Map: **3+** repeated patterns across distinct sections/tiles (name them and the sections).\n  - Failure Theme: name the core problem (e.g., bold\u2011only hierarchy; value flicker; device\u2011mock collage; container drift).\n  - Anchor Comparison: name nearest better/worse anchors and list **3+** deltas.\n  - Score Justification: why the final score follows from the above and any caps.\n</evaluation_rules>\n\n<rubric>\n\n## Typography (weight = 35%)\n\n**Examine:**\nTypeface quality and appropriateness; pairing logic; hierarchy through scale/weight/spacing/tone (not just bold); readability (body **45\u201380 characters**, line height **1.3\u20131.7**, tighter for display without collisions); consistency (heading levels, lists, links including underline **thickness/offset**, baseline rhythm, quotes/apostrophes, superscript/subscript alignment, casing); micro\u2011craft (optical kerning in all\u2011caps, punctuation spacing, small\u2011caps quality, number alignment, rag/hyphen control).\n\nTypography scoring method (principled, non\u2011token):\n- Score the following sub\u2011factors 1\u20135 in your reasoning (keep JSON unchanged):\n  1) Hierarchy (multi\u2011modal: size + weight/spacing/tone)\n  2) Readability (measure/leading/contrast)\n  3) Consistency (scale steps, casing, labels, links/states across sections)\n  4) Micro\u2011craft (baseline rhythm, optical alignment, underline tuning, punctuation)\n- Weakest\u2011link soft cap: if any sub\u2011factor \u2264 2, **Typography \u2264 3** unless you present **\u22653 counter\u2011signals** addressing that sub\u2011factor across multiple sections.\n- Evidence ceiling: with single\u2011section evidence or missing state/link proof, **Typography \u2264 3**.\n- Anchor alignment: keep Typography within **\u00b10.5** of the nearest calibration anchor unless you list **\u22653 concrete deltas** explaining the difference inside the explanation.\n\n**Score 5 \u2014 Exceptional**\n\n* A minimal style set yields a rich, unmistakable hierarchy with impeccable rhythm across sections.\n* A single family or pairing is mastered; details are tuned (optical alignment, kerning, consistent ascender/cap spacing, intentional hyphenation, no widows/orphans, clean list indents).\n* A distinctive yet highly readable voice; links/labels are rigorously consistent, including states and edge cases.\n\n**Score 4 \u2014 Strong**\n\n* Clear hierarchy with restrained, consistent styles; measures and leading are comfortable across sections.\n* A visible scale system (e.g., modular ratios) spans multiple elements; link styling is customized and consistent or intentionally conservative.\n* **Common system faces can earn 4** when rhythm, measures, punctuation, casing, and link treatment are disciplined and repeat. Minor issues only.\n\n**Score 3 \u2014 Competent baseline**\n\n* Readable with adequate hierarchy using a limited style set; may feel generic.\n* Defaults (system sans + near\u2011default link blue) are acceptable but not broken.\n* Small inconsistencies may appear (close heading levels, uneven list indents, occasional baseline drift or widows/orphans, inconsistent smart quotes, one over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps, minor nav/hero mismatches).\n\n**Score 2 \u2014 Below average**\n\n* Multiple issues reduce clarity/polish: inconsistent casing; \u201ceverything bold\u201d; random word\u2011level bolding; emoji bullets that break rhythm; over\u2011indented lists; heavy dividers; random tracking or all\u2011caps; display/mono used for body; mixed fonts between buttons and body; default link styling with thick default underline; mixed link treatments; repeated widows/orphans or unstable baselines. Voice reads junior despite legibility.\n\n**Score 1 \u2014 Poor**\n\n* Flat or confusing hierarchy; style proliferation; unreadable measures (e.g., \\~90\u2013100ch hero); collisions/overlaps; inconsistent quotes/apostrophes; broken lists/labels.\n\n**Pull\u2011downs to 2 (or 1 if frequent):** default link blue with default underline; unreasoned serif/sans mixing; visible reflow collisions; mismatched button fonts or strokes; harsh, oversized nameplate in navigation.\n\n**Refined minimal vs generic minimal:**\n\n* **Refined**: tuned neutrals; customized underline weight/offset; disciplined scale steps; stable baselines; optical alignment of icons/marks; consistent micro\u2011labels/dates; intentional hyphenation; bullets align with text; consistent casing.\n* **Generic**: default link blue/underline; uneven paragraph spacing; arbitrary size jumps; mixed alignment without rationale; unmodified \u201cNotion\u2011export\u201d toggles/dividers; emoji bullets; oversized or over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; nav/hero compete for scale.\n\n---\n\n## Layout (weight = 35%)\n\n**Examine:**\nGrid usage (columns, gutters, container widths) and spacing system (multiples of 4/8/12); structural clarity (sections, scan paths, focal points, navigation affordances); image presentation (consistent crops, device\u2011frame consistency or bespoke mats, matched radii/borders/shadows, readable screenshots); innovation with control (novel structures that aid comprehension); breadth of evidence across sections and visible breakpoints.\n\n**Score 5 \u2014 Exceptional**\n\n* Masterful, point\u2011of\u2011view structure that elevates clarity while remaining disciplined.\n* Immaculate rhythm and alignment at visible breakpoints; optical fixes for asymmetric content; long, complex grids stay in sync.\n* Assets are harmonized (radii, borders, shadows, captions) with flawless consistency; even large galleries maintain exact mats/captions/gutters.\n\n**Score 4 \u2014 Strong**\n\n* Consistent grid and spacing; clear section hierarchy; strong alignment across sections.\n* Image/asset handling is deliberate and cohesive; cards/tiles feel unified.\n* Long repeated grids are disciplined (identical mats, radii, caption positions, gutter rhythm). Minor roughness is acceptable.\n* Uniform card grids may earn 4 only when mats/radii/spacing are notably refined and captions/labels are disciplined. Considered collage can also earn 4 when gutters, baselines, and captions repeat exactly and no crops are cut off.\n\n**Score 3 \u2014 Competent baseline**\n\n* A basic grid is present and mostly consistent; sections are readable with adequate spacing.\n* Common patterns (single column, centered hero, simple card grid, left\u2011text/right\u2011image hero) are executed decently but without a clear point of view.\n* Some inconsistencies may appear (gutters, container widths, vertical rhythm, image placement); device frames show light tuning.\n\n**Score 2 \u2014 Below average**\n\n* Structural problems: drifting container widths without rationale; unexplained switches between centered and left alignment; awkward rags; floaty calls to action that ignore the grid; masonry/collage tiles with inconsistent whitespace or cut\u2011off crops; small unreadable screenshots in generic device mocks; mixed tile ratios that cause rhythm flicker; inconsistent internal mats; oversized headings that overpower content; misaligned buttons/captions; billboard backgrounds crowd real content. Layout feels like an uncustomized template.\n\n**Score 1 \u2014 Poor**\n\n* Random placement; competing focal points; inconsistent widths/gutters; severe readability issues.\n* Haphazard screenshot handling; inconsistent radii/shadows; elements hug edges or overflow at visible breakpoints.\n\n**Common deductions and caps:**\n\n* Evidence limited to a **single hero or short view \u2192 cap at 3**, unless **Single\u2011view Pass** applies.\n* \u201cClean but generic\u201d templates (centered hero + simple grid with soft shadows/rounded corners and no point of view) should **not exceed 3** without visible refinement.\n* Repeated template modules with little customization: **cap at 3** and note **template scent high**.\n* If **\u22653 sloppy\u2011image cues** (cut\u2011offs, unreadable mocks, mixed radii/crops), **cap Layout at 2** and pull **Color** down when value flicker comes from mismatched whites/mats.\n\n---\n\n## Color (weight = 30%)\n\n**Examine:**\nPalette quality (harmony, hue/value control, consistency); neutrals (tuned grays/blacks, hue\u2011shifted borders/shadows, subtle overlays); accent strategy (sparseness and role clarity, link/call\u2011to\u2011action states); integration with imagery (does the shell unify diverse screenshots via mats, border tints, shadow logic, and sequencing).\n\n**Score 5 \u2014 Exceptional**\n\n* A sophisticated palette with precise value control; accents are sparse yet effective.\n* Neutrals and shadows are tuned; borders/overlays have intentional tints; varied content is unified effortlessly, including complex artwork.\n* Color expresses identity without noise and remains consistent across sections and states.\n\n**Score 4 \u2014 Strong**\n\n* A harmonious palette with controlled accents; link/call\u2011to\u2011action logic is clear or strongly implied by usage.\n* Neutrals are intentionally tuned (off\u2011black/off\u2011white) to support readability and hierarchy; gradients/illustrations sit comfortably within the system.\n* Conservative blue accents can still earn 4 when mats, borders, and grays are tuned and unify colorful content. Minor issues only.\n\n**Score 3 \u2014 Competent baseline**\n\n* A serviceable palette; the shell uses a single accent or default\u2011ish link blue acceptably.\n* When colorful tiles carry most color, the chrome does not clash but lacks unifying tactics that would lift it to 4.\n* States may be missing but are implied by stable patterns.\n\n**Score 2 \u2014 Below average**\n\n* Too many hues or values with little throughline; loud tiles overpower a claimed single\u2011accent scheme.\n* Flat, untuned grays; stark #000/#fff pairs; default bright link blue; inconsistent state colors.\n* Mixed tile backgrounds or mismatched whites cause grid flicker; full\u2011color social icons/client logos add noise; unnecessary colored outlines.\n* Pastel mats are attempted but overwhelmed by saturated foregrounds; value jumps (e.g., a saturated footer) break the page\u2019s structure.\n\n**Score 1 \u2014 Poor**\n\n* Clashing gradients; muddy overlays; illegible contrast; chaotic color with no role clarity.\n\n**Pull\u2011downs to 2:** pure #000/#fff with harsh default blue; mismatched tile backgrounds; muddy overlays; random hover colors; inconsistent visited link behavior; pastel mats that fail to unify saturated UIs; noisy social/logo rows; aggressive value jumps.\n\n**Tuned minimal vs default minimal:**\n\n* **Tuned**: slightly desaturated or hue\u2011shifted blue; consistent underline thickness/offset; hover/visited handled or implied; off\u2011black/off\u2011white neutrals; very light, even dividers; unified mats/shadows.\n* **Default**: pure black/white; harsh default blues; heavy generic shadows; inconsistent border tints; tile radii/shadows that do not match; multicolor logos/emoji adding noise.\n\n---\n\n# Red flags\n\nFlag these when clearly present and reflect them in explanations.

Reconstruction (Type Scale): Only two site styles are evident\u2014small nav labels and possibly a section title state implied by the active \u201cWork\u201d. No visible body text to judge measure/leading; headings/captions absent. Hierarchy relies on gallery tile imagery rather than type. Link/State Audit: The active \u201cWork\u201d is darker than \u201cAbout,\u201d implying a state, but no underline/hover/visited evidence across sections. Consistency Map: repeated sans for nav; restrained weight usage; consistent letterspacing tone; brand marks sit centered within tiles with ample negative space. Failure Theme: Limited on\u2011site type system; hierarchy is delegated to imagery; missing link treatment tuning. Anchor Comparison: Closest anchor = candidate_9.jpg (3/3/3). Versus exemplar_1.jpg (4\u2011level discipline), this lacks: (1) a visible modular scale across headings/body, (2) tuned link underline/offset rules, (3) paragraph rhythm and list/caption alignment.

Anchor Comparison: Closer to candidate_19 (layout 2) than candidate_33 (layout 3) due to the unreadable mock, uneven spacing, and weak grid coherence; stronger anchors (exemplar_1) maintain tight mats/gutters and gallery consistency absent here.

Preflight cues seen (for context): unreadable small UI inside device frames (tile 1), device\u2011frame collage with tiny UI (tile 1), mismatched mats/whites across tiles (value flicker).

The hero uses intentional white space with a single centered object, then snaps into the left\u2011anchored editorial rhythm below. Preflight: sloppy cues = 0 (no irregular masonry, no mismatched radii or heavy shadows, no unreadable device collage intent); template cues = 0\u20131 (no left\u2011text/right\u2011device hero template; no boilerplate footer or \u2018Made with\u2019 badge). Reconstruction (Grid/Spacing): Consistent container width; grids appear 4\u20135 columns with uniform gutters (likely 8/12\u2011based scaling); vertical spacing between header/meta/grid repeats in equal increments; captions/labels align to the grid left edge. Link/State Audit: The M/L control indicates an interactive element with coherent placement and states; otherwise the page relies on content tiles as primary affordances without floating CTAs. Consistency Map: (1) Identical section scaffolding repeated end\u2011to\u2011end; (2) even gutters and tile ratios across all galleries; (3) section titles align to the same left column; (4) recurring position/format of the size toggle. Failure Theme: Asset unification is intentionally light\u2014tiles bring their own backgrounds, which can create visual density; layout point\u2011of\u2011view is refined but not novel. Anchor Comparison: Closest anchors: exemplar_1 (L=4) and candidate_33 (L=3). Deltas vs candidate_33: tighter gutters, steadier section rhythm, better gallery discipline. Not at L=5 (e.g., candidate_35/14/20) because there\u2019s no evidence of complex breakpoint choreography or advanced asset harmonization (mats/radii/border/shadow system) across long galleries.
