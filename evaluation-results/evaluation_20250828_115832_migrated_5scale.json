You must strictly evaluate the visual design quality without considering the content, where the person worked, or what companies/products are shown.\n\n## Evaluation Rules:\n\n1. **Score each dimension on a 1-4 scale** using the provided rubric anchors:\n   - 1: Very bad\n   - 2: Below average  \n   - 3: Above average\n   - 4: Great\n\n2. **For each dimension, you MUST:**\n   - Provide a score (1-4)\n   - Write a detailed explanation of WHY you gave that score\n   - Cite specific visual evidence (e.g., \"inconsistent spacing between sections\", \"serif/sans-serif pairing creates strong hierarchy\")\n   - Rate your confidence in the score (1-4 scale where 1=very uncertain, 4=very confident)\n\n3. **Avoid context bias:**\n   - DO NOT be influenced by company names, logos, or prestigious brands shown\n   - DO NOT consider the actual content/copy of case studies\n   - DO NOT factor in where the person worked or what they worked on\n   - Focus ONLY on the visual execution and design craft\n\n4. **Be consistent with the exemplars:**\n   - Use the provided exemplar ratings as calibration for your scores\n   - Apply the same standards strictly across all evaluations\n\n5. **Check for red flags** and list them if present:\n   - template_scent_high\n   - sloppy_images\n   - process_soup\n\n## Output Format:\n\nReturn **only** valid JSON matching this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": \"X\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"typography\": {\n      \"score\": 1-4,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-4\n    },\n    \"layout_composition\": {\n      \"score\": 1-4,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\", \n      \"confidence\": 1-4\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"score\": 1-4,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-4\n    }\n  },\n  \"red_flags\": [\"list any that apply\"],\n  \"overall_weighted_score\": calculated_number,\n  \"overall_confidence\": calculated_number\n}\n```\n\n## Scoring Calculation:\n- overall_weighted_score = (typography \u00d7 0.35) + (layout_composition \u00d7 0.35) + (color \u00d7 0.30)\n- overall_confidence = average of individual dimension confidences\n\n---\n\n## Evaluation Rubric\n\n```json\n{\n  \"rubric\": {\n    \"dimensions\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"typography\",\n        \"weight\": 0.35,\n        \"good_anchor\": [\n          \"Uses few fonts and styles with clear intentionality\",\n          \"Achieves great visual hierchy and information architecture with a few well-chosing styles\",\n          \"Bonus points for creative and effective use of typography as signature design elements\",\n          \"Alternatively, uses a lot of fonts but with a strong design intent and strategy (rare but possible)\",\n          \"Use of paid typefaces from type foundries\",\n          \"If combining multiple typefaces, they are choosing contrasting fonts that also have something to tie them together\",\n          \"If using google fonts they are using the good ones (IBM plex, Inter, Work, Fira, etc.)\"\n        ],\n        \"weak_anchor\": [\n          \"Too many fonts, too many weights, sizes, styles where it's not needed or without a clear design intent\",\n          \"Overly large type sizes for body text (18px+)\",\n          \"Excessive all-caps, letter-spacing\",\n          \"Different sections of the website change text alignment in an unintentional way e.g. left, center, then back to left\",\n          \"Type sizes don't have a scale and rythm. e.g. captions are 11px, body is 18px, and headers are 22px\",\n          \"Unconstrained line-width that make reading hard.
