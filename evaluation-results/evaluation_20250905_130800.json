Your task is to rate a candidate\u2019s craft from 1\u20135 using only the evidence visible in their portfolio screenshots (not the written story or r\u00e9sum\u00e9), and to return a concise, structured JSON assessment.\n</instructions>\n\n<evaluation_rules>\n\nHard Gates (MUST \u2013 JSON schema stays exactly the same; include any required signals inside the explanation strings)\n- Preflight counts and caps:\n  - You MUST count and write inside each dimension explanation: `sloppy_count: N`, `template_count: N`.\n  - If `sloppy_count \u2265 3` \u2192 add red_flag \"sloppy_images\"; set **Layout \u2264 2**; if value flicker from mismatched whites/mats \u2192 **Color \u2264 2**.\n  - If `template_count \u2265 3` \u2192 add red_flag \"template_scent_high\"; set **Typography \u2264 3** and **Layout \u2264 3**.\n  - List \u22652 concrete cues for any red_flag and state `caps_applied: [list]` in the explanation.\n\n- Anchor clamp (per-dimension and overall):\n  - In each dimension explanation, you MUST name `anchor: <calibration_example_or_img_name>` and list deltas if you diverge: `anchor_deltas: [delta1, delta2, delta3]`.\n  - Keep each dimension within **\u00b10.5** of its nearest anchor unless you list **\u22653 concrete deltas**; otherwise round the score **toward the anchor** to within 0.5.\n  - Choose a single closest overall anchor; keep **overall** within **\u00b10.5** of that anchor unless **\u22653 cross\u2011dimension deltas** are listed in the explanations.\n\n- Single\u2011view enforcement:\n  - Tag each Observation with section markers like `[hero]`, `[grid]`, `[testimonial]`, `[footer]`, `[gallery]` and include `sections_seen: [..]` at the end of the explanation.\n  - If fewer than **2 distinct sections** are cited for a dimension, set that dimension **\u2264 3** and set **overall_confidence \u2264 3** (state this explicitly).\n\nScoring:\n* **Score 3** is the competent baseline.\n* Use **4\u20135 only** when criteria are clearly met **across multiple sections**, or when the **Single\u2011view Pass** applies.\n* **Default to 3** when evidence is mixed, default\u2011ish, or generic.\n* **Single\u2011view Pass** (rare): Only grant **4\u20135** when ALL apply:\n  - Each dimension shows **\u22654 concrete micro\u2011craft signals** specific to that dimension (e.g., tuned underline thickness/offset; stable baseline; matched mats/radii; even gutter rhythm; unified values; readable screenshots).\n  - No caps are triggered by the Preflight Checklist.\n  - Set **confidence \u2264 3** and explicitly note limited evidence. Otherwise cap each dimension at **3**.\n\nGeneral:\n* Think carefully which score to assign for each criteria in the rubric based. Supplement your understanding of the rubric with the exemplars provided.\n* Don't be overfident in your analysis. It's better to say when you are not sure by providing a low confidence score. Being confident and wrong is bad.\n\nPreflight Checklist (complete BEFORE scoring; list findings inside each explanation)\n- Sloppy cues (count each): cut\u2011off crops; unreadable small UI; mixed/mismatched radii; heavy/inconsistent shadows; inconsistent mats; white\u2011balance mismatch; irregular masonry gutters; emoji bullets; default link blue + default underline; device\u2011frame collage with tiny UI.\n- Template cues (count each): \u201cI\u2019m [Name]\u201d hero; left text/right device hero; uniform 2\u2011column rows with outline \u201cVIEW PROJECT\u201d; billboard background words; default link styles; boilerplate footer; \u201cMade with \u2026\u201d badge; identical 12/16 radii; default Tailwind/Bootstrap tokens; unmodified Notion/Figma blocks.\n- Caps and flags:\n  - If sloppy cues \u2265 3 \u2192 add red_flag \"sloppy_images\"; **Layout \u2264 2**; if value flicker from mismatched whites/mats \u2192 **Color \u2264 2**.\n  - If template cues \u2265 3 \u2192 add red_flag \"template_scent_high\"; **Typography \u2264 3** and **Layout \u2264 3**.\n  - For any red_flag, cite **\u22652 concrete cues**.\n\nSloppy cue scoring (to reduce ambiguity):\n- Any device mock where UI text/icons are unreadable at presented size \u2192 +1 sloppy cue per instance.\n- Any visible cut\u2011off crop \u2192 +1 per affected tile/image.\n- Any mismatched whites/mats causing value flicker across tiles/rows \u2192 +1.\n- Any irregular masonry gutters (ragged bottoms/tops) \u2192 +1.\n\nEnforcement Rules (must follow; do not change JSON schema):\n- When Preflight thresholds trigger, you MUST add the corresponding red_flag(s) and apply the cap(s) to dimension scores BEFORE computing overall.\n- Compute base = 0.35*Typography + 0.35*Layout + 0.30*Color, then subtract penalties exactly:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.6; sloppy_images: 0.5; process_soup: 0.2.\n- Never exceed a cap once triggered. If your narrative cites a cap, your JSON scores must reflect that cap.\n\nCalibration Anchors (use exemplars actively)\n- Identify the closest **1\u20132 calibration examples** by structure and visual patterns (name them).\n- Keep each dimension within **\u00b10.5** of the closest anchor unless you cite **\u22653 concrete counter\u2011signals** for that dimension.\n- If overall differs by **>0.5** from the closest anchor, explicitly justify with those counter\u2011signals; otherwise **round down** to within 0.5.\n  - Place anchor names and the counter\u2011signals inside each dimension\u2019s explanation (no JSON field changes).\n  - Overall anchor clamp: choose the single closest overall anchor; keep the overall score within **\u00b10.5** of that anchor unless you list **\u22653 cross\u2011dimension deltas**. When uncertain, round **toward** the anchor, not away.\n\nSingle\u2011view Strict Cap + Proof Quota:\n- If evidence is limited to a single view/section, you MUST list **\u22654 dimension\u2011specific micro\u2011craft signals** in each explanation to justify a score > 3 for that dimension; otherwise that dimension \u2264 3.\n- With single\u2011view evidence, set **confidence \u2264 3** and state limited evidence in the explanation.\n\nEditorial Minimal Safe\u2011Harbor:\n- If the page exhibits strong editorial minimal signals (e.g., stable multi\u2011column rhythm, tuned neutrals, disciplined micro\u2011labels, sparse accent use) and no red_flags are present:\n  - Do not set **Typography < 4** or **Layout < 4** unless you list **\u22652 concrete defects per dimension across \u22652 sections**.\n  - If you set a dimension < 4 without that defect listing, round that dimension up to **4**.\n  - Also, do not rate overall < **3.5** unless you list **\u22653 concrete defects across \u22652 dimensions**.\n\nConfidence Discipline:\n- If single\u2011view evidence or any red_flag is present \u2192 **overall_confidence \u2264 3** (prefer \u2264 2.5). Confidence should track evidence breadth and ambiguity.\n\nStructured Reasoning Protocol (applies to each dimension explanation; keep JSON unchanged):\n- Use labeled mini\u2011sections inside your explanation string and end with a one\u2011line checklist:\n  - Observations: 2\u20133 concrete visuals from **\u22652 sections/tiles** marked like `[hero]`, `[grid]`, `[footer]`.\n  - Reconstruction: for Typography \u2192 Type Scale (H1/H2/body/meta; leading; casing; baseline rhythm); for Layout \u2192 Grid/Spacing (container width sequence, columns, gutters, caption alignment, reading path); for Color \u2192 Unification & State Logic (neutrals, mats/border tints/shadows, link/CTA roles/states).\n  - Link/State Audit: how links/CTAs signal state across sections (or a clear, repeated implication).\n  - Consistency Map: **3+** repeated patterns across distinct sections/tiles (name them and the sections).\n  - Failure Theme: name the core problem (e.g., bold\u2011only hierarchy; value flicker; device\u2011mock collage; container drift).\n  - Anchor Comparison: name nearest better/worse anchors and list **3+** deltas.\n  - Score Justification: why the final score follows from the above and any caps.\n  - Checklist (end of explanation, one line): `sections_seen: [..]; sloppy_count: N; template_count: N; caps_applied: [..]; anchor: <..>; anchor_deltas: [..]`.\n</evaluation_rules>\n\n<rubric>\n\n## Typography (weight = 35%)\n\n**Examine:**\nTypeface quality and appropriateness; pairing logic; hierarchy through scale/weight/spacing/tone (not just bold); readability (body **45\u201380 characters**, line height **1.3\u20131.7**, tighter for display without collisions); consistency (heading levels, lists, links including underline **thickness/offset**, baseline rhythm, quotes/apostrophes, superscript/subscript alignment, casing); micro\u2011craft (optical kerning in all\u2011caps, punctuation spacing, small\u2011caps quality, number alignment, rag/hyphen control).\n\nTypography scoring method (principled, non\u2011token):\n- Score the following sub\u2011factors 1\u20135 in your reasoning (keep JSON unchanged):\n  1) Hierarchy (multi\u2011modal: size + weight/spacing/tone)\n  2) Readability (measure/leading/contrast)\n  3) Consistency (scale steps, casing, labels, links/states across sections)\n  4) Micro\u2011craft (baseline rhythm, optical alignment, underline tuning, punctuation)\n- Weakest\u2011link soft cap: if any sub\u2011factor \u2264 2, **Typography \u2264 3** unless you present **\u22653 counter\u2011signals** addressing that sub\u2011factor across multiple sections.\n- Evidence ceiling: with single\u2011section evidence or missing state/link proof, **Typography \u2264 3**.\n- Anchor alignment: keep Typography within **\u00b10.5** of the nearest calibration anchor unless you list **\u22653 concrete deltas** explaining the difference inside the explanation.\n\nTypography pull\u2011downs (apply strictly):\n- If any of these are observed without counter\u2011signals across \u22652 sections \u2192 **Typography \u2264 2**: default link blue with default underline; bold\u2011only hierarchy; random tracking/over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; mismatched button fonts; repeated widows/orphans; unstable baselines.\n- Two\u2011modal hierarchy required (size + weight/spacing/tone). If hierarchy is single\u2011modal, **Typography \u2264 3**.\n\n## Layout (weight = 35%)\n\n**Examine:**\nGrid usage (columns, gutters, container widths) and spacing system (multiples of 4/8/12); structural clarity (sections, scan paths, focal points, navigation affordances); image presentation (consistent crops, device\u2011frame consistency or bespoke mats, matched radii/borders/shadows, readable screenshots); innovation with control (novel structures that aid comprehension); breadth of evidence across sections and visible breakpoints.\n\nCommon deductions and caps:\n* Evidence limited to a **single hero or short view \u2192 cap at 3**, unless **Single\u2011view Pass** applies.\n* \u201cClean but generic\u201d templates (centered hero + simple grid with soft shadows/rounded corners and no point of view) should **not exceed 3** without visible refinement.\n* Repeated template modules with little customization: **cap at 3** and note **template scent high**.\n* If **\u22653 sloppy\u2011image cues** (cut\u2011offs, unreadable mocks, mixed radii/crops), **cap Layout at 2** and pull **Color** down when value flicker comes from mismatched whites/mats.\n\n## Color (weight = 30%)\n\n**Examine:**\nPalette quality (harmony, hue/value control, consistency); neutrals (tuned grays/blacks, hue\u2011shifted borders/shadows, subtle overlays); accent strategy (sparseness and role clarity, link/call\u2011to\u2011action states); integration with imagery (does the shell unify diverse screenshots via mats, border tints, shadow logic, and sequencing).\n\nPull\u2011downs to 2 (apply strictly):\n* Pure #000/#fff with harsh default blue; mismatched tile backgrounds; muddy overlays; random hover colors; inconsistent visited links; pastel mats that fail to unify saturated UIs; noisy social/logo rows; aggressive value jumps.\n\n# Red flags\n\nFlag these when clearly present and reflect them in explanations.

Reconstruction: Single-column flow with generous outer gutters; tiles have consistent widths but imagery is presented as collage with small, unreadable device screenshots; captions align left under images. Grid rhythm is okay but product visuals are minimized by heavy mats and props. Image Presentation: multiple device frames with tiny UI, differing background textures (beige, burgundy, green) and irregular cutouts cause value flicker; product UIs are hard to read at presented size.
