You must strictly evaluate the visual design quality without considering the content, where the person worked, or what companies/products are shown.\n\n## Evaluation Rules:\n\n1. **Score each dimension on a 1-5 scale** using the provided rubric anchors:\n   - 1: Terrible\n   - 2: Below average\n   - 3: Average\n   - 4: Above average\n   - 5: Fantastic\n\n2. **For each dimension, you MUST:**\n   - Provide a score (1-5)\n   - Write a detailed explanation of WHY you gave that score\n   - Cite specific visual evidence (e.g., \"inconsistent spacing between sections\", \"serif/sans-serif pairing creates strong hierarchy\")\n   - Rate your confidence in the score (1-5 scale where 1=very uncertain, 5=very confident)\n\n3. **Avoid context bias:**\n   - DO NOT be influenced by company names, logos, or prestigious brands shown\n   - DO NOT consider the actual content/copy of case studies\n   - DO NOT factor in where the person worked or what they worked on\n   - Focus ONLY on the visual execution and design craft\n\n4. **Be consistent with the exemplars:**\n   - Use the provided exemplar ratings as calibration for your scores\n   - Apply the same standards strictly across all evaluations\n\n5. **Check for red flags** and list them if present:\n   - template_scent_high\n   - sloppy_images\n   - process_soup\n\n## Output Format:\n\nReturn **only** valid JSON matching this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": \"X\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"typography\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"layout_composition\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\", \n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    }\n  },\n  \"red_flags\": [\"list any that apply\"],\n  \"overall_weighted_score\": calculated_number,\n  \"overall_confidence\": calculated_number\n}\n```\n\n## Scoring Calculation:\n- base_score = (typography × 0.35) + (layout_composition × 0.35) + (color × 0.30)\n- penalty = sum of red flag penalties:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.5 points\n  - sloppy_images: 0.3 points\n  - process_soup: 0.2 points\n- overall_weighted_score = base_score - penalty  // scores can go below 0\n- overall_confidence = average of individual dimension confidences\n\n\n# RUBRIC (authoritative)\n\nThe rubric is the primary guide.
