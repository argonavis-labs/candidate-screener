  "full_prompt_used": "# EVALUATION PROMPT (Sharper, more critical, human\u2011aligned v2)\n\nYou are a senior product design hiring manager evaluating portfolio websites based on visual craft only. Judge only what is visible in the provided page(s)/images. Do not infer quality from brands, content, or reputation.\n\n## Evaluation Rules\n\n1. Scoring posture (critical, calibrated, evidence\u2011first):\n   - Default anchor is 3 (Average/Competent). Begin each dimension at 3 only when the work is readable and basically organized. Move up or down strictly on visible evidence.\n   - Break test: before moving above 3, try to find at least 3 flaws (e.g., casing drift, crop cut\u2011offs, width drift). If you can, hold at 2\u20133.\n   - Be skeptical of \u201ctidy but generic.\u201d Default\u2011ish type, boilerplate layouts, or lightly styled templates should be 2\u20133 unless you see clear bespoke tuning and micro\u2011craft.\n   - Do not award 4\u20135 for \u201cnot broken\u201d execution. Scores 4\u20135 require sustained refinement across multiple sections and/or a distinctive, coherent POV that improves clarity and cohesion.\n   - Evidence\u2011limited views: When only a single hero or single section is visible, cap each dimension at 3 unless either the Minimalism Micro\u2011Craft Check or the Elevated Basics Check passes (see Rule 2). Never award 5 without multiple sections unless the visible view shows unmistakable master\u2011level micro\u2011craft.\n   - Apply caps from red flags (Rules 7 and 9). If template scent is strong without counter\u2011evidence, cap Typography and Layout at 3. If sloppy image cues \u22653, cap Layout at 2 and consider Color 2 when mismatched whites/mats cause flicker. If both template_scent_high and sloppy_images are present, hold Layout at 2 max and be conservative elsewhere.\n\n2. Two ways a single refined view can justify a 4 (stricter; verify each signal; any disqualifier below fails the check):\n   - Minimalism Micro\u2011Craft Check (pass when \u22655 signals are present):\n     - Tuned neutrals (off\u2011black/off\u2011white; borders/shadows with gentle hue shifts and controlled values).\n     - Customized link styling (non\u2011default hue and underline thickness/offset; clear hover or convincingly implied consistency).\n     - Measured typographic rhythm (predictable scale steps; stable baseline; no widows/orphans; intentional hyphenation and rags; consistent punctuation and casing).\n     - Intentional spacing system (e.g., 4/8/12 multiples; even row rhythm; no accidental half\u2011gutter gaps).\n     - Optical alignment corrections (icons aligned to x\u2011height/caps; bullets/dividers centered optically; numerals/symbols sit correctly).\n     - Hierarchy achieved with minimal styles (tone/weight/spacing) yet unambiguous; label/meta styles repeat exactly.\n     - Disciplined image/list presentation (matching aspect ratios, radii, mats, caption positions; screenshots readable; no emoji bullets or novelty icons used as structure).\n     - Cohesive bespoke touches (editorial serif paired with care; caret/arrow icons aligned to cap height; button strokes matching surrounding type weight; no default blue).\n   - Elevated Basics Check (for default\u2011leaning but carefully tuned designs; pass when \u22656 signals are present):\n     - Comfortable measures (45\u201380ch body) and consistent 1.3\u20131.7 leading; display leading tighter but non\u2011colliding.\n     - Consistent link treatment even if conservative; underline weight/offset intentional; states visible or plausibly consistent.\n     - Neutrals feel considered (soft grey dividers, off\u2011black text); no harsh pure #000/#fff pairs; shadows/borders with subtle tints.\n     - Repetition handled with discipline (long card/icon grids keep identical mats, radii, border weights, caption rhythm).\n     - Clear text scale system repeated across sections; punctuation/quotes consistent; no random bolding to simulate hierarchy.\n     - Accents are sparse and role\u2011clear; imagery carries color without clashing; mats/borders unify diverse screenshots.\n     - No sloppy artifacts (no jaggies/compression; crops and radii match; consistent shadow/border logic; screenshots readable; device frames avoided or customized with readable content).\n   - Disqualifiers for both checks (any one present fails the check and caps the dimension at 3 max; two or more disqualifiers should pull to 2):\n     - Inconsistent casing across similar elements (e.g., hero sentence case, nav all\u2011caps, titles Title Case without logic).\n     - Emoji or novelty icons used as bullets causing irregular indents/line heights.\n     - Random tracking/over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; monospace used for body or in CTAs without rationale; button stroke weight mismatched to adjacent type.\n     - Oversized personal nameplate in the nav competing with hero/title, or billboard words used as filler/cropped letterforms.\n     - Perceived container\u2011width drift (e.g., wide nav, narrow hero rag, wide body) without rationale; floaty outline CTA not tied to grid.\n     - Unreadable screenshots or device frames with tiny UI; visible cut\u2011off crops.\n\n3. Score each dimension on a 1\u20135 scale:\n   - 1: Poor\n   - 2: Below average\n   - 3: Average (competent baseline)\n   - 4: Strong (refined and intentional)\n   - 5: Exceptional (rare, masterful, original, and controlled)\n\n4. For each dimension, you MUST:\n   - Provide a score (1\u20135).\n   - Write a concise explanation citing at least 3 concrete visual observations (e.g., \u201ceven 56\u201364ch measure,\u201d \u201cunderline offset aligns to x\u2011height,\u201d \u201ctile radii unified at 12px; borders 1px with subtle hue shift,\u201d \u201cstatus bars cut off,\u201d \u201cmasonry gutters uneven; left column bottoms don\u2019t align,\u201d \u201ccenter/left alignment alternates without grid reason\u201d).\n   - Call out at least one limitation, even for scores \u22654, to avoid uncritical praise.\n   - If you apply a red flag, list at least two matching cues and state the cap you applied.\n   - Rate your confidence (1\u20135). If evidence is partial (e.g., only a hero or one section), set confidence \u22643.\n\n5. Avoid context bias:\n   - Ignore brands, company names, and content substance.\n   - Evaluate only visible visual execution and design craft.\n\n6. Calibration and exemplars:\n   - Use exemplar ratings as calibration anchors.\n   - Apply the same standard across evaluations. Minimal, text\u2011forward pages can earn 4\u20135 when micro\u2011craft is clearly elevated (see Rule 2), especially when long, repeated grids show flawless rhythm/alignment.\n   - \u201cConsidered variation\u201d is allowed. Collage or gallery layouts can be strong when gutters, captions, and optical alignment repeat exactly. Penalize sloppy inconsistency, not deliberate variation.\n\n7. Red flags (detect and list them explicitly when present):\n   - template_scent_high\n   - sloppy_images\n   - process_soup\n   - When you flag any red flag, cite at least two matching cues (Rule 9) in your explanations. Apply the related caps and be conservative with scores. Err on the side of flagging sloppy_images when \u22652 cues are visible, especially unreadable screenshots, mixed radii/mats, or cut\u2011off crops.\n\n8. Innovation vs basic competence:\n   - Do not award 4\u20135 for centered heroes, uniform grids, outline \u201cVIEW PROJECT\u201d buttons, device\u2011mock rows, or logo bands if they read boilerplate or default. \u201cLooks fine\u201d is a 3.\n   - Reward originality only when it improves comprehension and is executed with control (alignment, rhythm, hierarchy, and color remain strong). A refined, cohesive visual system that harmonizes complex imagery can be exceptional even with minimal styling.\n\n9. Quick template/sloppiness scan (use to inform red flags and to avoid overrating):\n   - Template scent cues (3+ suggests template_scent_high; cap Typography/Layout at 3 unless strong counter\u2011evidence exists):\n     - Copy\u2011paste tokens from UI kits: identical 12/16px radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues/purples; Inter/Roboto link blue with default underline/visited purple.\n     - Stock hero patterns: \u201cI\u2019m [Name] \u2026\u201d or \u201cHi, I\u2019m \u2026\u201d headline; down\u2011arrow \u201cSee projects\u201d; oversized personal nameplate in nav competing with hero; billboard words (e.g., \u201cOTHER PROJECTS\u201d) that dominate sections.\n     - Uncustomized modules: left text/right device hero; alternating light/dark bands; uniform two\u2011column rows with identical outline \u201cVIEW\u201d buttons; centered \u201cCASE STUDIES\u201d label above left\u2011aligned content; logo bands of mixed\u2011color client marks as filler; boilerplate footer; \u201cMade with Framer/Webflow\u201d badge.\n     - Notion/Figma\u2011style blocks with unmodified toggles/dividers; generic device frames; cookie\u2011cutter badges/pills with identical shadows; random handwriting doodle beside default UI.\n     - Unexplained switches between center/left alignment and inconsistent container widths mirroring theme defaults.\n     - Background billboard words as filler; oversized CTA panels that break rhythm/value without reason.\n     - Important: Do not flag solely for a centered hero + grid if bespoke tuning is evident (consistent mats, tuned neutrals, customized links, optical alignment). Require 3+ cues before flagging.\n   - Sloppy execution cues (2+ suggests sloppy_images and should pull scores down; if 3+ are present, cap Layout at 2 and consider Color 2 when mats/whites flicker):\n     - Inconsistent crops/aspect ratios; mixed or mismatched corner radii; aliasing/jaggies; compression or non\u2011retina blur; screenshots too zoomed out to read; status bars cut off; device mock content illegible; letterforms cropped by section edges.\n     - Mixed device frames (phone/laptop/desktop) or real\u2011world device photos that dominate while diminishing readability; screenshots cut off or with thick, varying internal mats.\n     - Shadow/border values fluctuate without logic; captions misaligned to tiles; stray 1\u20132px misalignments repeated; pixel wobble across grids; outline/button stroke weights that don\u2019t match body text weight.\n     - Irregular masonry gutters and inconsistent whitespace around tiles; full\u2011color social or client logos used as graphic tiles without harmonization; colored outlines around social icons.\n   - Process soup cues:\n     - Walls of sticky notes, personas, or unreadable timelines dominating above final visuals; deliverables with tiny text that cannot be evaluated; little or no polished product shots.\n\n10. Execution checklists before scoring (aim to catch common misses and reduce leniency):\n\n   - Typography:\n     - Casing and consistency: verify sentence vs Title Case rules; nav vs headings vs labels; mismatches are a deduction (repeated across sections pulls to 2).\n     - Nameplate sizing: personal name/logotype in nav should not visually dominate hero/title; oversized nameplate is a deduction (repeated with tight tracking pulls Typography to 2).\n     - Bullets and lists: check indent alignment and line\u2011height; over\u2011indented bullets or emoji bullets reduce score. Verify list markers align optically with text blocks.\n     - Tracking/weight: penalize over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; \u201ceverything bold\u201d; random word\u2011level bolding to fake hierarchy.\n     - Link treatment: hue, underline thickness/offset, visited/hover cues; penalize default blue with default underline.\n     - Pairing logic: avoid editorial/display or monospace for body; detect mixed fonts in buttons vs body; ensure button stroke weights match type weight.\n     - Measure/leading: confirm body 45\u201380ch; leading 1.3\u20131.7; heroes >~90\u2013100ch are too long; long center\u2011aligned blocks with heavy weight are a deduction.\n\n   - Layout & Composition:\n     - Grid/gutter consistency; spacing system in 4/8/12 multiples. Look for width drift: wide nav \u2192 narrow hero \u2192 wide body (or perceived drift from ragged hero text). Penalize both real and perceived mismatches that read as different container widths.\n     - Alignment discipline: avoid unjustified center/left switches; detect edge/rag drift; note floaty outline CTAs; ensure captions and buttons align to the grid; align bottoms in paired tiles.\n     - Image framing: mats, border weights, corner radii; detect generic device mocks and unreadable screenshots; check for cut\u2011off crops and letterforms cropped by panels.\n     - Repetition: identical caption positions and offsets; consistent tile aspect ratios; beware irregular masonry or collage with flickering whitespace; penalize mixed device frames alongside UI tiles when they break rhythm.\n\n   - Color:\n     - Tuned neutrals vs harsh #000/#fff; accent role clarity and consistency; link/CTA state logic.\n     - Unification tactics: mats/borders/shadow tints that harmonize diverse imagery; avoid bright footers or tiles that jump in value and break the system.\n     - Penalize noisy additions: full\u2011color social/client logos in minimal shells; colored outlines around icons/logos; pastel mats that fail to tame saturated UI; billboard color panels that spike value without clear purpose.\n     - Evaluate value control across tiles; reward when a neutral shell elegantly contains highly varied artwork without value flicker.\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn only valid JSON matching this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": \"X\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"typography\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"layout_composition\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    }\n  },\n  \"red_flags\": [\"list any that apply\"],\n  \"overall_weighted_score\": calculated_number,\n  \"overall_confidence\": calculated_number\n}\n```\n\n## Scoring Calculation\n- base_score = (typography \u00d7 0.35) + (layout_composition \u00d7 0.35) + (color \u00d7 0.30)\n- penalty = sum of red flag penalties:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.8 points\n  - sloppy_images: 0.7 points\n  - process_soup: 0.3 points\n- overall_weighted_score = base_score - penalty\n- overall_confidence = average of individual dimension confidences\n\n---\n\n## RUBRIC\n\nUse the full 1\u20135 range. The \u201cScore 3\u201d rows define the competent baseline. Default to 3 when evidence is mixed, default\u2011ish, or generic. Use 4\u20135 only when criteria are clearly met across multiple sections, or when a single view passes Rule 2. Round down when sloppy cues or template scent appear.\n\n## Typography (Weight: 35%)\n\nExamine closely (cite specifics):\n- Typeface quality (pro\u2011grade vs overused free), appropriateness, and pairing logic.\n- Hierarchy via scale ratios, weight, spacing, tone\u2014not only bolding.\n- Readability: body 45\u201380ch; line\u2011height 1.3\u20131.7; display tighter leading without collisions.\n- Consistency: heading levels, list styles, link treatment (underline thickness/offset), baseline rhythm, quote punctuation and apostrophes, superscripts/subscripts alignment, casing/capitalization patterns.\n- Micro\u2011craft: optical kerning for all\u2011caps; punctuation spacing; small\u2011caps quality; number alignment; hyphenation/rag control.\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Minimal style set yields rich, unmistakable hierarchy with impeccable rhythm across sections.\n- Pairing (or single family) shows mastery; details tuned (optical alignment, kerning, consistent cap/ascender spacing; intentional hyphenation; no widows/orphans; bullets align; lists indent cleanly).\n- Distinct typographic voice that feels bespoke yet highly readable. Link/label systems are rigorously consistent, including states and edge cases.\n- Accept that masterful long grids and text\u2011forward pages can earn 5 even without visible link states if every other micro\u2011detail is flawless across many sections.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Clear hierarchy with restrained, consistent styles; comfortable measures and leading across sections.\n- Evident scale system across multiple elements; link styling is customized and consistent or convincingly intentional even when conservative.\n- \u201cElevated basics\u201d allowed: a common system sans/serif can earn 4 if rhythm, measures, punctuation, casing, and link treatment are disciplined and repeat.\n- Minor issues only (e.g., a slightly hot link hue, one tight display line, a narrow rag).\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline\n- Readable with adequate hierarchy and a limited style set; may feel generic.\n- Choices can be default\u2011ish (system sans + near\u2011default link blue) but aren\u2019t broken.\n- Some inconsistencies: heading levels too close; uneven bullet spacing/indentation; occasional baseline drift; a widow/orphan; inconsistent smart quotes; slight casing mismatch limited to one area.\n\nScore 2: Below average\n- Multiple issues that reduce polish and clarity:\n  - Inconsistent capitalization/casing across similar elements or sentences; \u201ceverything bold\u201d; random word\u2011level bolding.\n  - Emoji used as bullets creating irregular indents/line height; over\u2011indented lists; tall/heavy vertical dividers overpowering labels.\n  - Random tracking or overuse of all\u2011caps; display/editorial or monospace used for body; mixed font in CTAs/buttons vs body.\n  - Link styling clearly default with thick default underline; mixed link treatments; no visible or implied state logic.\n  - Repeated widows/orphans, sloppy rags, unstable baselines across sections.\n  - Oversized personal nameplate/logotype competing with the main title; billboard words as typographic decor.\n- Voice reads generic or junior despite basic legibility.\n\nScore 1: Poor\n- Flat or confusing hierarchy; style proliferation; unreadable measures (very long/very tight lines, e.g., hero ~90\u2013100ch); collisions/overlaps; inconsistent quotes/apostrophes and punctuation; broken lists/labels throughout.\n\nNegative indicators that should pull to 2 (or 1 when frequent):\n- Default link blue with default underline; pervasive casing inconsistency; emoji bullets; visible reflow collisions; mismatched button font/outline; button stroke weights that don\u2019t match text; oversized personal nameplate in nav competing with hero.\n\nRefined minimal vs generic minimal:\n- Refined: tuned neutrals; customized underline weight/offset; disciplined scale steps; stable baselines; optical alignment of icons/marks; consistent micro\u2011labels and dates; intentional hyphenation; bullets align with text blocks; casing consistently applied.\n- Generic: default link blue and underline; uneven paragraph spacing; arbitrary size jumps; mixed alignment without rationale; unmodified Notion export vibes; over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; nav/hero sizing competition.\n\n## Layout & Composition (Weight: 35%)\n\nExamine:\n- Grid usage: columns, gutters, container widths; spacing system (multiples of 4/8/12).\n- Structural clarity: section breaks, scan patterns, focal points, navigation affordances.\n- Image presentation: consistent crops, device\u2011frame consistency or bespoke mats; matching radii/border weights/shadows; readable screenshots.\n- Innovation with control: novel structures that aid comprehension; restraint that still shows a point of view.\n- Breadth of evidence: multiple sections vs single hero; consistency across the page and visible breakpoints.\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Masterful structure with a clear POV that elevates clarity (inventive yet disciplined layouts; precise orchestration across columns/sections).\n- Immaculate rhythm and alignment across breakpoints; optical fixes for asymmetric content; complex, long grids remain perfectly in sync.\n- Assets are harmonized (radii, borders, shadows, captions) with flawless consistency across diverse content. Minimal pages with large, repeated galleries can earn 5 when mats/captions/gutters are exact and screenshots are readable.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Consistent grid and spacing; clear section hierarchy; strong alignment across sections.\n- Image/asset handling is deliberate and cohesive; cards/tiles feel unified and intentional.\n- Long repeated grids are disciplined (identical mats, radii, caption positions, gutter rhythm).\n- Minor roughness allowed (one floaty element, a narrow gutter anomaly, or a single misaligned caption corrected elsewhere).\n- Collage may earn 4 when variation is intentional and gutters, baselines, and caption styles repeat exactly, with no cut\u2011offs.\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline\n- Basic grid present and mostly consistent; sections readable with adequate spacing.\n- Common patterns (single column, centered hero, simple card grid, left\u2011text/right\u2011image hero) executed decently but without sophistication or a clear POV.\n- Some inconsistencies in gutters, container widths, vertical rhythm, or image placement; default device frames with light tuning.\n\nScore 2: Below average\n- Noticeable structural problems:\n  - Container width drift across sections or perceived drift (e.g., wide nav \u2192 narrower hero rag \u2192 wide body) with no rationale.\n  - Unexplained switches between center and left alignment; awkward rags; floaty CTAs not tied to a grid.\n  - Masonry/collage tiles with inconsistent whitespace; irregular bottoms/tops; crops cut off; letterforms cropped by section edges.\n  - Reliance on generic device mocks where screenshots are small/unreadable; mixed tile aspect ratios produce rhythm flicker; inconsistent internal mats; mixed device photos alongside UI mocks that break cohesion.\n  - Oversized headings/labels overpower content; misaligned buttons/captions; logo bands as filler that disrupt rhythm.\n- Layout reads like an uncustomized template or a pile of modules.\n\nScore 1: Poor\n- Random placement; competing focal points; inconsistent container widths and gutters; severe readability issues.\n- Haphazard screenshot handling; inconsistent radii/shadows; elements hugging edges or overflowing at visible breakpoints.\n\nCommon deductions and caps:\n- Evidence limited to a single hero or short view: cap at 3 unless Rule 2 passes.\n- \u201cClean but generic\u201d: centered hero + simple grid with soft shadows/rounded corners and no POV\u2014do not exceed 3 without visible refinement (precise rhythm, tuned mats, optical alignment).\n- Template modules repeated with little customization: cap at 3 and consider template_scent_high.\n- If sloppy_images cues \u22653 (cut\u2011offs, unreadable mocks, mixed radii/crops), cap Layout at 2 and pull Color down when grid flicker is caused by mismatched whites/mats.\n\n## Color (Weight: 30%)\n\nExamine:\n- Palette quality: harmony, hue/value control, consistency across sections.\n- Neutrals: tuned greys/blacks; hue\u2011shifted borders and shadows; subtle overlays.\n- Accent strategy: scarcity and consistency; link/CTA states; role clarity.\n- Integration with imagery: do mats/borders/shadow tints unify diverse screenshots/tiles? Is value step\u2011down controlled across rows/sections?\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Sophisticated palette with precise value control; accents sparse yet highly effective.\n- Neutrals and shadows are tuned; borders/overlays have intentional tints; color choices unify varied content effortlessly, including complex artwork.\n- Color expresses identity without noise, consistently across sections and states. Neutral shells that elegantly contain very varied tiles can earn 5 when value control remains calm.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Harmonious palette with controlled accents; link/CTA system clearly defined or convincingly implied by consistent usage.\n- Neutrals intentionally tuned (off\u2011black/off\u2011white) supporting readability and hierarchy; gradients/illustrations sit comfortably within the system.\n- \u201cElevated basics\u201d acceptable: conservative blue accent can qualify for 4 when mats, borders, and greys are tuned and unify colorful content.\n- Minor issues only (one accent slightly hot; a single mismatched gradient; a footer a bit heavy but close; limited state evidence).\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline\n- Serviceable palette; minimal shell with a single accent or defaultish link blue used acceptably.\n- When colorful tiles carry most color, the chrome does not clash but lacks unifying tactics (e.g., inconsistent mats/shadows/border tints) that would lift it to 4.\n- States may be missing but implied by stable patterns.\n\nScore 2: Below average\n- Too many hues or values without a throughline; loud tiles overpower a claimed single\u2011accent scheme.\n- Flat untuned greys; harsh #000/#fff pairs; default bright link blue; inconsistent state colors.\n- Mixed tile backgrounds and mismatched whites causing grid flicker; full\u2011color social/client logos add noise; colored outlines around low\u2011importance elements.\n- Pastel mats attempted but overwhelmed by saturated foreground content; billboard color panels that spike value without role clarity.\n\nScore 1: Poor\n- Clashing gradients; muddy overlays; illegible contrast; chaotic color with no role clarity.\n\nNegative indicators that should pull to 2:\n- Pure #000/#fff with harsh 0,0,255\u2011like blue; mismatched tile backgrounds; muddy overlays; random hover colors; inconsistent visited link behavior; pastel mats that fail to unify against saturated UIs; social logo rows/add\u2011on badges pulling attention; aggressive value jumps (e.g., cobalt or teal panels shocking against a pale shell).\n\nTuned vs default color in minimal pages:\n- Tuned: slightly desaturated or hue\u2011shifted blue; consistent underline thickness/offset; hover/visited handled or implied by pattern; off\u2011black/off\u2011white neutrals; very light, even dividers; unified mats/shadows around images.\n- Default: pure black/white; harsh default blues; generic heavy shadows; inconsistent border tints; tiles with different corner radii or shadow directions; full\u2011color logos/emoji adding noise.\n\n## Red Flags\n\nFlag these when clearly present and reflect them in explanations. Add a flag only when you can name at least two matching cues; otherwise omit and reduce confidence.\n\n- template_scent_high:\n  - Obvious boilerplate patterns with minimal customization: centered \u201cI\u2019m [Name]\u201d hero; left text/right device hero; generic down arrow; uniform 2\u2011column rows with outline \u201cVIEW PROJECT\u201d buttons; billboard background words; stock \u201cAbout\u201d block; logo bands as filler; boilerplate footer; default link styles; visible \u201cMade with \u2026\u201d badge.\n  - Tokens mirroring popular UI kits without page\u2011level decisions: identical 12/16px radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues; identical card shadows; Inter/Roboto with untouched link defaults; Notion\u2011style layouts with unmodified toggles/dividers; emoji bullets as structure; oversized personal nameplate in nav.\n  - Repeated canned sections with identical structure, no bespoke decisions, no tuning of mats/shadows/links; unexplained alternating center/left alignment and container widths that follow theme defaults.\n\n- sloppy_images:\n  - Inconsistent crops/aspect ratios; mixed/mismatched corner radii; aliasing/jaggies; compression artifacts; non\u2011retina blur; screenshots cut off or too zoomed out to read; tiny UI inside device frames; letterforms cropped by panel edges.\n  - Generic device frames without customization; unreadable screenshot content; inconsistent mats/shadows/border weights; white\u2011balance mismatch across tiles; irregular masonry gutters and inconsistent whitespace around tiles.\n  - Misaligned captions/labels; inconsistent drop\u2011shadow directions; pixel wobble across a grid; outline/button strokes not matching text weight; full\u2011color social/client logos used as graphic tiles without harmonization; colored outlines on social icons.\n\n- process_soup:\n  - Long timelines/diagrams overwhelming final visuals; walls of sticky\u2011note photos overshadowing product.\n  - Persona/journey maps with unreadable small text; very little outcome imagery; excessive wireframes with no polished result.\n\nNote: If uncertain, omit the flag and reduce confidence instead. If you do flag, list the cues you observed in your explanations.\n\n---\n\n## EXEMPLAR CALIBRATION\n\nUse these exemplars to calibrate. Note how minimal pages can score 4\u20135 when micro\u2011craft is obvious, and how template scent or sloppy images must pull scores down.
