  "full_prompt_used": "<instructions>\nYou are a senior product design hiring manager with deep taste in visual design craft for product UI. Your task is to rate a candidate\u2019s craft from 1\u20135 using only the evidence visible in their portfolio screenshots (not the written story or r\u00e9sum\u00e9), and to return a concise, structured JSON assessment.\n</instructions>\n\n<evaluation_rules>\nScoring:\n* **Score 3** is the competent baseline.\n* Use **4\u20135 only** when criteria are clearly met **across multiple sections**, or when the **Single\u2011view Pass** applies.\n* **Default to 3** when evidence is mixed, default\u2011ish, or generic.\n* **Single\u2011view Pass** (rare): Only grant **4\u20135** when ALL apply:\n  - Each dimension shows **\u22654 concrete micro\u2011craft signals** specific to that dimension (e.g., tuned underline thickness/offset; stable baseline; matched mats/radii; even gutter rhythm; unified values; readable screenshots).\n  - No caps are triggered by the Preflight Checklist.\n  - Set **confidence \u2264 3** and explicitly note limited evidence. Otherwise cap each dimension at **3**.\n\n---\n\nGeneral:\n* Think carefully which score to assign for each criteria in the rubric based. Supplement your understanding of the rubric with the exemplars provided. \n* Don't be overfident in your analysis. It's better to say when you are not sure by providing a low confidence score. Being confident and wrong is bad.\n\nPreflight Checklist (complete BEFORE scoring; list findings inside each explanation)\n- Sloppy cues (count each): cut\u2011off crops; unreadable small UI; mixed/mismatched radii; heavy/inconsistent shadows; inconsistent mats; white\u2011balance mismatch; irregular masonry gutters; emoji bullets; default link blue + default underline; device\u2011frame collage with tiny UI.\n- Template cues (count each): \u201cI\u2019m [Name]\u201d hero; left text/right device hero; uniform 2\u2011column rows with outline \u201cVIEW PROJECT\u201d; billboard background words; default link styles; boilerplate footer; \u201cMade with \u2026\u201d badge; identical 12/16 radii; default Tailwind/Bootstrap tokens; unmodified Notion/Figma blocks.\n- Caps and flags:\n  - If sloppy cues \u2265 3 \u2192 add red_flag \"sloppy_images\"; **Layout \u2264 2**; if value flicker from mismatched whites/mats \u2192 **Color \u2264 2**.\n  - If template cues \u2265 3 \u2192 add red_flag \"template_scent_high\"; **Typography \u2264 3** and **Layout \u2264 3**.\n  - For any red_flag, cite **\u22652 concrete cues**.\n\nSloppy cue scoring (to reduce ambiguity):\n- Any device mock where UI text/icons are unreadable at presented size \u2192 +1 sloppy cue per instance.\n- Any visible cut\u2011off crop \u2192 +1 per affected tile/image.\n- Any mismatched whites/mats causing value flicker across tiles/rows \u2192 +1.\n- Any irregular masonry gutters (ragged bottoms/tops) \u2192 +1.\n\nEnforcement Rules (must follow; do not change JSON schema):\n- When Preflight thresholds trigger, you MUST add the corresponding red_flag(s) and apply the cap(s) to dimension scores BEFORE computing overall.\n- Compute base = 0.35*Typography + 0.35*Layout + 0.30*Color, then subtract penalties exactly:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.6; sloppy_images: 0.5; process_soup: 0.2.\n- Never exceed a cap once triggered. If your narrative cites a cap, your JSON scores must reflect that cap.\n\nCalibration Anchors (use exemplars actively)\n- Identify the closest **1\u20132 calibration examples** by structure and visual patterns (name them).\n- Keep each dimension within **\u00b10.5** of the closest anchor unless you cite **\u22653 concrete counter\u2011signals** for that dimension.\n- If overall differs by **>0.5** from the closest anchor, explicitly justify with those counter\u2011signals; otherwise **round down** to within 0.5.\n  - Place anchor names and the counter\u2011signals inside each dimension\u2019s explanation (no JSON field changes).\n  - Overall anchor clamp: choose the single closest overall anchor; keep the overall score within **\u00b10.5** of that anchor unless you list **\u22653 cross\u2011dimension deltas**. When uncertain, round **toward** the anchor, not away.\n\nSingle\u2011view Strict Cap + Proof Quota:\n- If evidence is limited to a single view/section, you MUST list **\u22654 dimension\u2011specific micro\u2011craft signals** in each explanation to justify a score > 3 for that dimension; otherwise that dimension \u2264 3.\n- With single\u2011view evidence, set **confidence \u2264 3** and state limited evidence in the explanation.\n\nEditorial Minimal Safe\u2011Harbor:\n- If the page exhibits strong editorial minimal signals (e.g., stable multi\u2011column rhythm, tuned neutrals, disciplined micro\u2011labels, sparse accent use) and no red_flags are present:\n  - Do not set **Typography < 4** or **Layout < 4** unless you list **\u22652 concrete defects per dimension across \u22652 sections**.\n  - If you set a dimension < 4 without that defect listing, round that dimension up to **4**.\n  - Also, do not rate overall < **3.5** unless you list **\u22653 concrete defects across \u22652 dimensions**.\n\nConfidence Discipline:\n- If single\u2011view evidence or any red_flag is present \u2192 **overall_confidence \u2264 3** (prefer \u2264 2.5). Confidence should track evidence breadth and ambiguity.\n\nStructured Reasoning Protocol (applies to each dimension explanation; keep JSON unchanged):\n- Use labeled mini\u2011sections inside your explanation string:\n  - Observations: 2\u20133 concrete visuals from **\u22652 sections/tiles**.\n  - Reconstruction: for Typography \u2192 Type Scale (H1/H2/body/meta; leading; casing; baseline rhythm); for Layout \u2192 Grid/Spacing (container width sequence, columns, gutters, caption alignment, reading path); for Color \u2192 Unification & State Logic (neutrals, mats/border tints/shadows, link/CTA roles/states).\n  - Link/State Audit: how links/CTAs signal state across sections (or a clear, repeated implication).\n  - Consistency Map: **3+** repeated patterns across distinct sections/tiles (name them and the sections).\n  - Failure Theme: name the core problem (e.g., bold\u2011only hierarchy; value flicker; device\u2011mock collage; container drift).\n  - Anchor Comparison: name nearest better/worse anchors and list **3+** deltas.\n  - Score Justification: why the final score follows from the above and any caps.\n</evaluation_rules>\n\n<rubric>\n\n## Typography (weight = 35%)\n\n**Examine:**\nTypeface quality and appropriateness; pairing logic; hierarchy through scale/weight/spacing/tone (not just bold); readability (body **45\u201380 characters**, line height **1.3\u20131.7**, tighter for display without collisions); consistency (heading levels, lists, links including underline **thickness/offset**, baseline rhythm, quotes/apostrophes, superscript/subscript alignment, casing); micro\u2011craft (optical kerning in all\u2011caps, punctuation spacing, small\u2011caps quality, number alignment, rag/hyphen control).\n\nTypography scoring method (principled, non\u2011token):\n- Score the following sub\u2011factors 1\u20135 in your reasoning (keep JSON unchanged):\n  1) Hierarchy (multi\u2011modal: size + weight/spacing/tone)\n  2) Readability (measure/leading/contrast)\n  3) Consistency (scale steps, casing, labels, links/states across sections)\n  4) Micro\u2011craft (baseline rhythm, optical alignment, underline tuning, punctuation)\n- Weakest\u2011link soft cap: if any sub\u2011factor \u2264 2, **Typography \u2264 3** unless you present **\u22653 counter\u2011signals** addressing that sub\u2011factor across multiple sections.\n- Evidence ceiling: with single\u2011section evidence or missing state/link proof, **Typography \u2264 3**.\n- Anchor alignment: keep Typography within **\u00b10.5** of the nearest calibration anchor unless you list **\u22653 concrete deltas** explaining the difference inside the explanation.\n\n**Score 5 \u2014 Exceptional**\n\n* A minimal style set yields a rich, unmistakable hierarchy with impeccable rhythm across sections.\n* A single family or pairing is mastered; details are tuned (optical alignment, kerning, consistent ascender/cap spacing, intentional hyphenation, no widows/orphans, clean list indents).\n* A distinctive yet highly readable voice; links/labels are rigorously consistent, including states and edge cases.\n\n**Score 4 \u2014 Strong**\n\n* Clear hierarchy with restrained, consistent styles; measures and leading are comfortable across sections.\n* A visible scale system (e.g., modular ratios) spans multiple elements; link styling is customized and consistent or intentionally conservative.\n* **Common system faces can earn 4** when rhythm, measures, punctuation, casing, and link treatment are disciplined and repeat. Minor issues only.\n\n**Score 3 \u2014 Competent baseline**\n\n* Readable with adequate hierarchy using a limited style set; may feel generic.\n* Defaults (system sans + near\u2011default link blue) are acceptable but not broken.\n* Small inconsistencies may appear (close heading levels, uneven list indents, occasional baseline drift or widows/orphans, inconsistent smart quotes, one over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps, minor nav/hero mismatches).\n\n**Score 2 \u2014 Below average**\n\n* Multiple issues reduce clarity/polish: inconsistent casing; \u201ceverything bold\u201d; random word\u2011level bolding; emoji bullets that break rhythm; over\u2011indented lists; heavy dividers; random tracking or all\u2011caps; display/mono used for body; mixed fonts between buttons and body; default link styling with thick default underline; mixed link treatments; repeated widows/orphans or unstable baselines. Voice reads junior despite legibility.\n\n**Score 1 \u2014 Poor**\n\n* Flat or confusing hierarchy; style proliferation; unreadable measures (e.g., \\~90\u2013100ch hero); collisions/overlaps; inconsistent quotes/apostrophes; broken lists/labels.\n\n**Pull\u2011downs to 2 (or 1 if frequent):** default link blue with default underline; unreasoned serif/sans mixing; visible reflow collisions; mismatched button fonts or strokes; harsh, oversized nameplate in navigation.\n\n**Refined minimal vs generic minimal:**\n\n* **Refined**: tuned neutrals; customized underline weight/offset; disciplined scale steps; stable baselines; optical alignment of icons/marks; consistent micro\u2011labels/dates; intentional hyphenation; bullets align with text; consistent casing.\n* **Generic**: default link blue/underline; uneven paragraph spacing; arbitrary size jumps; mixed alignment without rationale; unmodified \u201cNotion\u2011export\u201d toggles/dividers; emoji bullets; oversized or over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; nav/hero compete for scale.\n\n---\n\n## Layout (weight = 35%)\n\n**Examine:**\nGrid usage (columns, gutters, container widths) and spacing system (multiples of 4/8/12); structural clarity (sections, scan paths, focal points, navigation affordances); image presentation (consistent crops, device\u2011frame consistency or bespoke mats, matched radii/borders/shadows, readable screenshots); innovation with control (novel structures that aid comprehension); breadth of evidence across sections and visible breakpoints.\n\n**Score 5 \u2014 Exceptional**\n\n* Masterful, point\u2011of\u2011view structure that elevates clarity while remaining disciplined.\n* Immaculate rhythm and alignment at visible breakpoints; optical fixes for asymmetric content; long, complex grids stay in sync.\n* Assets are harmonized (radii, borders, shadows, captions) with flawless consistency; even large galleries maintain exact mats/captions/gutters.\n\n**Score 4 \u2014 Strong**\n\n* Consistent grid and spacing; clear section hierarchy; strong alignment across sections.\n* Image/asset handling is deliberate and cohesive; cards/tiles feel unified.\n* Long repeated grids are disciplined (identical mats, radii, caption positions, gutter rhythm). Minor roughness is acceptable.\n* Uniform card grids may earn 4 only when mats/radii/spacing are notably refined and captions/labels are disciplined. Considered collage can also earn 4 when gutters, baselines, and captions repeat exactly and no crops are cut off.\n\n**Score 3 \u2014 Competent baseline**\n\n* A basic grid is present and mostly consistent; sections are readable with adequate spacing.\n* Common patterns (single column, centered hero, simple card grid, left\u2011text/right\u2011image hero) are executed decently but without a clear point of view.\n* Some inconsistencies may appear (gutters, container widths, vertical rhythm, image placement); device frames show light tuning.\n\n**Score 2 \u2014 Below average**\n\n* Structural problems: drifting container widths without rationale; unexplained switches between centered and left alignment; awkward rags; floaty calls to action that ignore the grid; masonry/collage tiles with inconsistent whitespace or cut\u2011off crops; small unreadable screenshots in generic device mocks; mixed tile ratios that cause rhythm flicker; inconsistent internal mats; oversized headings that overpower content; misaligned buttons/captions; billboard backgrounds crowd real content. Layout feels like an uncustomized template.\n\n**Score 1 \u2014 Poor**\n\n* Random placement; competing focal points; inconsistent widths/gutters; severe readability issues.\n* Haphazard screenshot handling; inconsistent radii/shadows; elements hug edges or overflow at visible breakpoints.\n\n**Common deductions and caps:**\n\n* Evidence limited to a **single hero or short view \u2192 cap at 3**, unless **Single\u2011view Pass** applies.\n* \u201cClean but generic\u201d templates (centered hero + simple grid with soft shadows/rounded corners and no point of view) should **not exceed 3** without visible refinement.\n* Repeated template modules with little customization: **cap at 3** and note **template scent high**.\n* If **\u22653 sloppy\u2011image cues** (cut\u2011offs, unreadable mocks, mixed radii/crops), **cap Layout at 2** and pull **Color** down when value flicker comes from mismatched whites/mats.\n\n---\n\n## Color (weight = 30%)\n\n**Examine:**\nPalette quality (harmony, hue/value control, consistency); neutrals (tuned grays/blacks, hue\u2011shifted borders/shadows, subtle overlays); accent strategy (sparseness and role clarity, link/call\u2011to\u2011action states); integration with imagery (does the shell unify diverse screenshots via mats, border tints, shadow logic, and sequencing).\n\n**Score 5 \u2014 Exceptional**\n\n* A sophisticated palette with precise value control; accents are sparse yet effective.\n* Neutrals and shadows are tuned; borders/overlays have intentional tints; varied content is unified effortlessly, including complex artwork.\n* Color expresses identity without noise and remains consistent across sections and states.\n\n**Score 4 \u2014 Strong**\n\n* A harmonious palette with controlled accents; link/call\u2011to\u2011action logic is clear or strongly implied by usage.\n* Neutrals are intentionally tuned (off\u2011black/off\u2011white) to support readability and hierarchy; gradients/illustrations sit comfortably within the system.\n* Conservative blue accents can still earn 4 when mats, borders, and grays are tuned and unify colorful content. Minor issues only.\n\n**Score 3 \u2014 Competent baseline**\n\n* A serviceable palette; the shell uses a single accent or default\u2011ish link blue acceptably.\n* When colorful tiles carry most color, the chrome does not clash but lacks unifying tactics that would lift it to 4.\n* States may be missing but are implied by stable patterns.\n\n**Score 2 \u2014 Below average**\n\n* Too many hues or values with little throughline; loud tiles overpower a claimed single\u2011accent scheme.\n* Flat, untuned grays; stark #000/#fff pairs; default bright link blue; inconsistent state colors.\n* Mixed tile backgrounds or mismatched whites cause grid flicker; full\u2011color social icons/client logos add noise; unnecessary colored outlines.\n* Pastel mats are attempted but overwhelmed by saturated foregrounds; value jumps (e.g., a saturated footer) break the page\u2019s structure.\n\n**Score 1 \u2014 Poor**\n\n* Clashing gradients; muddy overlays; illegible contrast; chaotic color with no role clarity.\n\n**Pull\u2011downs to 2:** pure #000/#fff with harsh default blue; mismatched tile backgrounds; muddy overlays; random hover colors; inconsistent visited link behavior; pastel mats that fail to unify saturated UIs; noisy social/logo rows; aggressive value jumps.\n\n**Tuned minimal vs default minimal:**\n\n* **Tuned**: slightly desaturated or hue\u2011shifted blue; consistent underline thickness/offset; hover/visited handled or implied; off\u2011black/off\u2011white neutrals; very light, even dividers; unified mats/shadows.\n* **Default**: pure black/white; harsh default blues; heavy generic shadows; inconsistent border tints; tile radii/shadows that do not match; multicolor logos/emoji adding noise.\n\n---\n\n# Red flags\n\nFlag these when clearly present and reflect them in explanations.

Reconstruction\u2014Type Scale: display serif appears around 40\u201356px in multiple lines with generous leading; supporting superscripts for dates use smaller size and superscript positioning; side nav is small caps/sans giving a second level. Readability: the long, continuous sentence runs close to a wide measure for display copy, making rags loose and slightly tiring; italics throughout reduce scanning contrast. Consistency: link color used twice (name and Zip) is consistent; numerals in superscript are handled consistently. Micro\u2011craft: decent optical spacing around commas/emdashes; superscripts sit on a consistent baseline; italic linking likely removes default underline; tracking feels tuned for display. Link/State Audit: links rely on color only (blue) with no visible underline/state proof; side nav shows separators but no hover/active logic visible. Consistency Map: (1) same serif\u2011italic voice across all lines, (2) same blue accent for links, (3) uniform off\u2011black text on off\u2011white background, (4) consistent superscript treatment for years.

Reconstruction (Type Scale): Hero ~28\u201332px serif, project titles ~16\u201318px, metas ~12\u201313px; leading appears 1.5\u20131.6 in body and tighter for titles; casing mixed but mostly sentence case; nav is small sans/serif set with adequate spacing. Readability is fine; hero measure ~35\u201345ch. Consistency: Repeated caption pattern (dot + title + meta) across multiple tiles; nav and footer styles are minimal but coherent. Micro\u2011craft: No visible tuning of link/underline states; titles feel under\u2011scaled relative to large image tiles; baseline rhythm between captions and images is loose.

Reconstruction (Grid/Spacing): Likely a centered container with a 2\u2011column grid; gutters are consistent horizontally but vertical rhythm breaks where the full\u2011width tile interrupts and where right/left tiles are different heights, creating ragged row bottoms.

Consistency Map: (1) Company label style above each project, (2) Title + one\u2011line description pattern, (3) Identical spacing above/below images, (4) Reused small glyph for company/section label. Failure Theme: Slightly safe voice; hero line breaks feel template\u2011ish rather than authored, but execution is polished. Anchor Comparison: Closest anchors\u2014Exemplar 6 and Exemplar 1. Similar disciplined scale and clean body rhythm; better than Exemplar 19 which is more generic. Deltas vs Exemplar 6: fewer expressive type accents, less editorial play; vs Exemplar 1: comparable rhythm and casing, slightly less distinctive display tone. Score Justification: Clear, consistent hierarchy and tuned measures across multiple sections warrant a 4.",

          "explanation": "Observations: Single wide column with consistent container width; section header 'Selected work' anchors the grid. Each project follows a repeatable layout: large asset tile with generous mats and soft shadow, paired with label/title/summary. Images have consistent padding and do not clip; device/render angles vary but keep equal margins. Preflight: no cut\u2011off crops, no unreadable micro\u2011UI at presented size, no irregular gutters. Reconstruction: Grid appears 1-column with strong vertical rhythm (~64\u201396px between blocks) and even internal gutters around image frames. Captions/labels align to the same left edge; scan path is linear and calm. Link/State Audit: Section\u2011level link ('See All Work') placed consistently in the right corner, visually subordinate; no rogue buttons breaking the grid. Consistency Map: (1) Identical project block scaffold, (2) Repeated label placement above titles, (3) Uniform image mats/shadows, (4) Consistent left alignment of text and assets. Failure Theme: Minor template scent in the hero (centered headline) and conservative single\u2011column structure; otherwise refined. Anchor Comparison: Closest anchors\u2014Exemplar 6 and Exemplar 1 which both show cohesive, well\u2011paced long pages. This portfolio matches their alignment discipline; more refined than Exemplar 19's lighter tile system.

Reconstruction: Unification & State Logic\u2014neutrals are tuned; accents are sparse and role\u2011based (nav/contact, small links).

Consistency Map: (1) White/very light gray mats on all screenshots, (2) Single accent reused in nav and small links, (3) Identical shadow value across tiles, (4) Desaturated, clean neutrals throughout. Failure Theme: Palette is safe rather than characterful; minimal state variety shown. Anchor Comparison: Similar to Exemplar 6 and Exemplar 1 where neutrals and controlled accents unify diverse imagery; more intentional than Exemplar 19\u2019s softer pastels.

          "explanation": "Observations: Hero uses a large display sans with a blurred-shadow treatment; right column intro uses a smaller, regular-weight sans with comfortable leading. Project cards repeat a clear pattern: title (semibold), one-paragraph description (regular), meta row with company \u2022 type \u2022 year, plus an uppercase status pill (tracked). Across several rows (First Draft relaunch, Notifications, ChromeOS PWA; Move management, MI scheduler) the hierarchy and sizes are consistent. Preflight: sloppy cues 0; template cues 1 (\"Hello, I'm [Name]\" hero). Reconstruction: Type scale appears disciplined\u2014Display (~96\u2013120), H2 card titles (~20\u201322), body (~14\u201316 with 1.45\u20131.6 leading), meta (~12\u201313 with reduced contrast). Sentence case throughout; status pills use uppercase with extra letter-spacing. Measures are comfortable and rags controlled; no widows/orphans visible. Baselines between title/desc/meta look steady. Link/State Audit: Navigation shows an active state via a soft gray pill for \"Work\"; cards imply clickability via image hover (not visible here) and consistent title weight; footer social icons are unified. Consistency Map: (1) Repeated status pill styling, (2) dot-separated meta line formatting, (3) consistent title/description spacing, (4) uniform nav pill treatment. Failure Theme: Minor\u2014hero blur effect slightly trades clarity for flair; otherwise hierarchy remains strong. Anchor Comparison: Closest anchors are Exemplar 19 (clean card grid with tuned type) and Exemplar 5 (highly refined editorial system). Compared to Exemplar 5, this page has fewer custom link/underline details and less typographic voice, but it\u2019s more refined than mid-level grids. Score Justification: Clear multi-level hierarchy, readable measures, and consistent styling across many cards merit a strong 4.",

Below, a 3-column card grid exhibits even gutters, stable alignment, and consistent card radii and mats across many tiles (e.g., Octoshop, Account settings, Museum AR/VR; NFT gallery, Menti, Design system). No chopped crops or ragged gutters; captions align uniformly under thumbnails. Preflight: sloppy cues 0; template cues 1 (hero intro pattern). Reconstruction: Likely 12-col grid with 3-up cards, balanced outer margins, and 24\u201332px gutters; vertical rhythm between title/desc/meta is repeated throughout. Card image ratios vary slightly but internal padding, corner radii, and caption blocks standardize the set. Header nav is clear with spaced items; footer aligns to the grid. Link/State Audit: Active nav pill is clear; cards read as primary affordances with stable caption blocks indicating content; no floating, off-grid CTAs. Consistency Map: (1) Identical card radii and padding, (2) fixed caption block structure, (3) uniform gutter rhythm between rows, (4) consistent hero-to-grid sectional spacing. Failure Theme: Minor masonry variance in card heights causes light vertical rhythm flicker, but alignment lines remain strong. Anchor Comparison: Similar to Exemplar 19\u2019s disciplined 3-up project grid; less experimental than Exemplar 5 but still controlled.

Thumbnails employ varied but mostly muted mats (lavender, forest, mustard, sky, pink, olive) that feel curated rather than random. Preflight: sloppy cues 0; template cues 0. Reconstruction: Neutrals appear slightly desaturated (not pure #000/#fff), aiding readability. Accent strategy is conservative\u2014emphasis via mats and the active nav pill rather than loud brand colors. Despite broad tile hues, values are controlled to prevent harsh jumps; shadows (if any) are minimal. Link/State Audit: Active nav coloring provides state logic; footer icons sit quietly. Consistency Map: (1) Repeated neutral status pill, (2) stable off-black text across all sections, (3) consistent gray background tying colorful mats together, (4) value-controlled mats preventing clash. Failure Theme: Some value flicker from brighter mats (e.g., orange, deep green) adjacent to pastels, but the neutral shell contains it. Anchor Comparison: Closer to Exemplar 19\u2019s muted shell + colorful thumbnails; not as perfectly unified as Exemplar 5, which uses stricter value control.
