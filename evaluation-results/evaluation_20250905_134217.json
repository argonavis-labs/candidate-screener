If uncertain, omit the flag and reduce confidence.\n- You MUST enforce caps in the numeric scores (do not exceed a cap you cited).\n\nAnchor clamp (binds outliers)\n- In each dimension explanation, name the nearest calibration reference with `anchor: <example_or_img_name>` and list `anchor_deltas: [delta1, delta2, delta3]` when you diverge.\n- Keep each dimension within **\u00b10.5** of its nearest anchor unless you list **\u22653 concrete deltas**; otherwise round the score **toward the anchor** to within 0.5.\n- Choose one closest overall anchor; keep **overall** within **\u00b10.5** of that anchor unless **\u22653 cross\u2011dimension deltas** are present in your explanations.\n\nEvidence breadth integrity (prevents single\u2011view inflation)\n- Canonical section taxonomy: hero, grid, project, article, about, testimonial, gallery, footer, contact, nav. Sub\u2011parts of a single hero (e.g., hero\u2011columns, cta) count as the same section.\n- At the end of each explanation, include: `sections_seen: [..]; unique_sections: N`.\n- Any dimension scored **\u2265 4** must cite evidence from **\u2265 2 unique sections**. If not, set that dimension **= 3** and **confidence \u2264 3**.\n- For a true Single\u2011view Pass (rare), you must list **\u22654 dimension\u2011specific micro\u2011signals** AND cite **no caps** AND set **confidence \u2264 3**. Otherwise keep **\u2264 3**.\n\nScoring:\n* **Score 3** is the competent baseline.\n* Use **4\u20135 only** when criteria are clearly met **across multiple sections**, or when a valid **Single\u2011view Pass** applies.\n* **Default to 3** when evidence is mixed, default\u2011ish, or generic.\n\nTypography method (principled, non\u2011token):\n- In your reasoning (not JSON schema), score these sub\u2011factors 1\u20135: (1) Hierarchy (size + weight/spacing/tone), (2) Readability (measure/leading/contrast), (3) Consistency (scale steps, casing, labels, link/state continuity), (4) Micro\u2011craft (baseline rhythm, alignment, underline tuning, punctuation).\n- Weakest\u2011link soft cap: if any sub\u2011factor \u2264 2, **Typography \u2264 3** unless you present **\u22653 counter\u2011signals** addressing that sub\u2011factor across multiple sections.\n- Two\u2011modal hierarchy required. If hierarchy relies on size alone, **Typography \u2264 3**.\n\nLayout discipline & template guardrails:\n- \u201cClean but generic\u201d shells (centered hero + simple grid + soft shadows/rounded corners, no bespoke decisions) should **not exceed 3** without visible refinement across **\u22652 sections**.\n- When **sloppy_images** cues accumulate (unreadable mocks, cut\u2011offs, mixed radii/crops, ragged masonry), enforce **Layout \u2264 2**.\n\nColor unification (avoid over\u2011penalizing tasteful variety):\n- Pull Color to **2** for value flicker that stems from mismatched mats/whites or clashing shell accents. Do not penalize mild, content\u2011driven variety when the shell uses consistent mats/border tints/shadows to unify.\n\nRed flags (add only with \u22652 explicit cues; otherwise lower confidence):\n- template_scent_high: boilerplate hero (\"I\u2019m [Name]\"), left\u2011text/right\u2011device hero with down arrow, uniform 2\u2011col rows with outline \u201cVIEW PROJECT\u201d, billboard words, default link styles/underlines, \u201cMade with \u2026\u201d badge, identical 12/16 radii, kit\u2011default tokens, unmodified Notion/Figma blocks.\n- sloppy_images: inconsistent crops/aspects; mixed radii; aliasing/jaggies/compression; too\u2011small/unreadable UI in device frames; inconsistent mats/shadows/border weights; white\u2011balance mismatch; ragged masonry gutters; cut\u2011off screenshots.\n- process_soup: walls of sticky notes/diagrams overshadowing product; unreadable personas/journeys; few polished outcomes.\n\nStructured Reasoning Protocol (inside each explanation; JSON unchanged)\n- Use labeled mini\u2011sections and end with a one\u2011line checklist:\n  - Observations: 2\u20133 concrete visuals from **\u22652 unique sections** (when claiming \u22654).\n  - Reconstruction: Typography \u2192 Type Scale; Layout \u2192 Grid/Spacing; Color \u2192 Unification & States.\n  - Link/State Audit: how links/CTAs signal state across sections.\n  - Consistency Map: **3+** repeated patterns across distinct sections.\n  - Failure Theme: name the core problem (e.g., bold\u2011only hierarchy; value flicker; device\u2011mock collage; container drift).\n  - Anchor Comparison: nearest anchor(s) + **3+** deltas if diverging > \u00b10.5.\n  - Score Justification: why the final score follows from caps/clamps.\n  - Checklist (one line): `sections_seen: [..]; unique_sections: N; sloppy_count: N; template_count: N; caps_applied: [..]; anchor: <..>; anchor_deltas: [..]`.\n\n</evaluation_rules>\n\n<rubric>\n\n## Typography (weight = 35%)\nExamine: typeface quality; pairing logic; hierarchy (size + weight/spacing/tone); readability (body 45\u201380ch; line height 1.3\u20131.7, tighter for display); consistency (heading levels, lists, links incl. underline thickness/offset, baseline rhythm, quotes/apostrophes, superscripts/subscripts, casing); micro\u2011craft (optical kerning in all\u2011caps, punctuation spacing, small\u2011caps quality, number alignment, rag/hyphen control).\n\n## Layout & Composition (weight = 35%)\nExamine: grid (columns, gutters, container widths) and spacing system; structural clarity (sections, scan paths, focal points, navigation); image presentation (consistent crops, device\u2011frame consistency or bespoke mats, matched radii/borders/shadows, readable screenshots); innovation with control; evidence breadth across sections/breakpoints.\n\n## Color (weight = 30%)\nExamine: palette quality (harmony, hue/value control, consistency); neutrals (tuned grays/blacks, hue\u2011shifted border/shadows, overlays); accent strategy (sparseness and role clarity, link/CTA states); integration with imagery (unifying mats, border tints, shadow logic, sequencing).\n\n</rubric>\n\n<scoring_calculation>\n- base_score = (typography \u00d7 0.35) + (layout_composition \u00d7 0.35) + (color \u00d7 0.30)\n- penalty = sum of red flag penalties:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.6 points\n  - sloppy_images: 0.5 points\n  - process_soup: 0.2 points\n- overall_weighted_score = base_score \u2212 penalty\n- overall_confidence = average of individual dimension confidences\n</scoring_calculation>\n\n<output_format>\n\nReturn only valid JSON matching this exact structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": \"X\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"typography\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"layout_composition\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    }\n  },\n  \"red_flags\": [\"list any that apply\"],\n  \"overall_weighted_score\": calculated_number,\n  \"overall_confidence\": calculated_number\n}\n```\n</output_format>\n\n<calibration_examples>\n  (same as current golden set)\n</calibration_examples>\n\n\n",

Reconstruction (Type Scale): clear two-modal hierarchy through size and color (display vs body), but heading levels aren\u2019t clearly stepped across sections and tracking/kerning in the huge display lines looks untreated. Readability: body measure/leading appear comfortable and contrast is good. Consistency: single grotesk family throughout, but link/CTA labels, nav, captions and project list don\u2019t share a visible, repeatable scale; casing and weights vary. Micro\u2011craft: punctuation/kerning around the apostrophe in 'Let\u2019s' and very tight letterfit in the massive display reduce polish; no visible hover/active link styles. Link/State Audit: top nav and footer CTAs have no visible state differentiation. Consistency Map: repeated Grotesk, red highlight for key nouns, pill CTAs. Failure Theme: billboard\u2011scale headings without a disciplined multi-level type scale. Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 8; anchor_deltas: 1) less consistent heading scale across sections, 2) fewer defined link/CTA states, 3) display kerning/tracking and rhythm less tuned than the anchor.

Project thumbnails bring their own unrelated fonts (LinkedIn slide deck title, orange mobile UI labels), creating a fragmented typographic voice. Reconstruction: Type Scale shows essentially two sizes (brand vs nav) and then uncontrolled typography inside thumbnails; hierarchy relies mostly on size with little weight/spacing modulation. Readability: adequate for the sparse nav, but many in\u2011tile captions/UIS are too small to read at this scale. Consistency: link text has no clear hover/active differentiation; casing and weights vary across tiles; no rhythm across rows. Micro\u2011craft: baseline and alignment drift in the grid; mixed sentence/Title case; punctuation/underline tuning absent. Link/State Audit: \"Portfolio/About\" look like plain text links; no state cues evident.

Some UIs are too small to read (chat screens), and several tiles sit on different white/near\u2011white mats creating patchy gutters. Reconstruction: Grid/Spacing lacks a consistent baseline; gutters shift as tile heights change; focal path is unclear because large photographic/branding tiles compete with small UI tiles. Image presentation mixes device frames, raw screens, and photos with inconsistent margins and shadows. Innovation is low; control is weak. Link/State Audit: Navigation is minimal and conventional; no section anchors or clear project cards with hover states.

Project rows use small caption-style labels (e.g., 'Sunflower', 'Xbox') with one-line descriptions beneath images. Footer has 'Let\u2019s chat!' with default-looking inline links. Reconstruction: Type scale is two-modal (very large display then small captions/body) with sparse mid-scale headings; readability is acceptable thanks to generous line height and short lines, but captions feel slightly light. Consistency is okay (same sans across sections, consistent left alignment under images), though link styling appears default and casing shifts between all-caps in hero and title case in captions. Micro-craft: spacing aligns cleanly; no visible baseline rhythm tuning or refined underline offsets; punctuation and letter-spacing in the tagline are fine but slightly loose. Link/State Audit: Top nav looks uniform with no visible active/hover state; footer links appear default underlined. Consistency Map: repeated use of small caption + description, consistent nav style, recurring all-caps for display moments.
