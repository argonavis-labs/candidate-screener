You must strictly evaluate the visual design quality without considering the content, where the person worked, or what companies/products are shown.\n\n## Evaluation Rules:\n\n1. **Score each dimension on a 1-5 scale** using the provided rubric anchors:\n   - 1: Terrible\n   - 2: Below average\n   - 3: Average\n   - 4: Above average\n   - 5: Fantastic\n\n2. **For each dimension, you MUST:**\n   - Provide a score (1-5)\n   - Write a detailed explanation of WHY you gave that score\n   - Cite specific visual evidence (e.g., \"inconsistent spacing between sections\", \"serif/sans-serif pairing creates strong hierarchy\")\n   - Rate your confidence in the score (1-5 scale where 1=very uncertain, 5=very confident)\n\n3. **Avoid context bias:**\n   - DO NOT be influenced by company names, logos, or prestigious brands shown\n   - DO NOT consider the actual content/copy of case studies\n   - DO NOT factor in where the person worked or what they worked on\n   - Focus ONLY on the visual execution and design craft\n\n4. **Be consistent with the exemplars:**\n   - Use the provided exemplar ratings as calibration for your scores\n   - Apply the same standards strictly across all evaluations\n\n5. **Check for red flags** and list them if present:\n   - template_scent_high\n   - sloppy_images\n   - process_soup\n\n## Output Format:\n\nReturn **only** valid JSON matching this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": \"X\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"typography\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"layout_composition\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\", \n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    }\n  },\n  \"red_flags\": [\"list any that apply\"],\n  \"overall_weighted_score\": calculated_number,\n  \"overall_confidence\": calculated_number\n}\n```\n\n## Scoring Calculation:\n- base_score = (typography \u00d7 0.35) + (layout_composition \u00d7 0.35) + (color \u00d7 0.30)\n- penalty = sum of red flag penalties:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.5 points\n  - sloppy_images: 0.3 points\n  - process_soup: 0.2 points\n- overall_weighted_score = base_score - penalty  // scores can go below 0\n- overall_confidence = average of individual dimension confidences\n\n\n# RUBRIC (authoritative)\n\nThe rubric is the primary guide.

          "explanation": "Clear, restrained system using one sans-serif family with a few weights. The hero headline is bold and tightly set, creating strong entry hierarchy; project cards repeat a consistent trio: small label, medium-weight title, and lighter description. Line lengths are well controlled and easy to scan. Minor knocks: supporting copy is a touch low-contrast gray and small; the center-aligned hero followed by left-aligned sections is fine but slightly breaks rhythm, and microlabels look a bit light/airy, keeping it from feeling typographically distinctive.",

          "score": 4,
          "explanation": "Consistent grid and vertical rhythm throughout. Generous white space frames the hero and each project block; spacing between sections feels even and intentional. Work previews are presented in cohesive containers with soft shadows and consistent perspective, tying disparate screenshots together. Alignment is clean (left edges of section titles, captions, and images line up). Not especially innovative, but very orderly and polished with no clutter or random placement.",

        "color": {
          "score": 4,
          "explanation": "Minimal palette dominated by white, deep navy for headlines, and neutral grays for body text. Accent colors are used sparingly (e.g., coral contact button, subtle blues in previews). The soft gray backgrounds and shadows on image tiles feel tuned rather than default, adding depth without heaviness. A small nit is the coral accent appearing mainly on the CTA, making the accent system feel a bit isolated rather than fully integrated across the page.",
