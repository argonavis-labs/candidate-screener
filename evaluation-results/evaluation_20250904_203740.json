  "full_prompt_used": "<instructions>\nYou are a senior product design hiring manager with deep taste in visual design craft for product UI. Your task is to rate a candidate\u2019s craft from 1\u20135 using only the evidence visible in their portfolio screenshots (not the written story or r\u00e9sum\u00e9), and to return a concise, structured JSON assessment.\n</instructions>\n\n<evaluation_rules>\nScoring:\n* **Score 3** is the competent baseline.\n* Use **4\u20135 only** when criteria are clearly met **across multiple sections**, or when the **Single\u2011view Pass** applies.\n* **Default to 3** when evidence is mixed, default\u2011ish, or generic.\n* **Single\u2011view Pass** (rare): Only grant **4\u20135** when ALL apply:\n  - Each dimension shows **\u22654 concrete micro\u2011craft signals** specific to that dimension (e.g., tuned underline thickness/offset; stable baseline; matched mats/radii; even gutter rhythm; unified values; readable screenshots).\n  - No caps are triggered by the Preflight Checklist.\n  - Set **confidence \u2264 3** and explicitly note limited evidence. Otherwise cap each dimension at **3**.\n\n---\n\nGeneral:\n* Think carefully which score to assign for each criteria in the rubric based. Supplement your understanding of the rubric with the exemplars provided. \n* Don't be overfident in your analysis. It's better to say when you are not sure by providing a low confidence score. Being confident and wrong is bad.\n\nPreflight Checklist (complete BEFORE scoring; list findings inside each explanation)\n- Sloppy cues (count each): cut\u2011off crops; unreadable small UI; mixed/mismatched radii; heavy/inconsistent shadows; inconsistent mats; white\u2011balance mismatch; irregular masonry gutters; emoji bullets; default link blue + default underline; device\u2011frame collage with tiny UI.\n- Template cues (count each): \u201cI\u2019m [Name]\u201d hero; left text/right device hero; uniform 2\u2011column rows with outline \u201cVIEW PROJECT\u201d; billboard background words; default link styles; boilerplate footer; \u201cMade with \u2026\u201d badge; identical 12/16 radii; default Tailwind/Bootstrap tokens; unmodified Notion/Figma blocks.\n- Caps and flags:\n  - If sloppy cues \u2265 3 \u2192 add red_flag \"sloppy_images\"; **Layout \u2264 2**; if value flicker from mismatched whites/mats \u2192 **Color \u2264 2**.\n  - If template cues \u2265 3 \u2192 add red_flag \"template_scent_high\"; **Typography \u2264 3** and **Layout \u2264 3**.\n  - For any red_flag, cite **\u22652 concrete cues**.\n\nSloppy cue scoring (to reduce ambiguity):\n- Any device mock where UI text/icons are unreadable at presented size \u2192 +1 sloppy cue per instance.\n- Any visible cut\u2011off crop \u2192 +1 per affected tile/image.\n- Any mismatched whites/mats causing value flicker across tiles/rows \u2192 +1.\n- Any irregular masonry gutters (ragged bottoms/tops) \u2192 +1.\n\nEnforcement Rules (must follow; do not change JSON schema):\n- When Preflight thresholds trigger, you MUST add the corresponding red_flag(s) and apply the cap(s) to dimension scores BEFORE computing overall.\n- Compute base = 0.35*Typography + 0.35*Layout + 0.30*Color, then subtract penalties exactly:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.6; sloppy_images: 0.5; process_soup: 0.2.\n- Never exceed a cap once triggered. If your narrative cites a cap, your JSON scores must reflect that cap.\n\nCalibration Anchors (use exemplars actively)\n- Identify the closest **1\u20132 calibration examples** by structure and visual patterns (name them).\n- Keep each dimension within **\u00b10.5** of the closest anchor unless you cite **\u22653 concrete counter\u2011signals** for that dimension.\n- If overall differs by **>0.5** from the closest anchor, explicitly justify with those counter\u2011signals; otherwise **round down** to within 0.5.\n  - Place anchor names and the counter\u2011signals inside each dimension\u2019s explanation (no JSON field changes).\n\nSingle\u2011view Strict Cap + Proof Quota:\n- If evidence is limited to a single view/section, you MUST list **\u22654 dimension\u2011specific micro\u2011craft signals** in each explanation to justify a score > 3 for that dimension; otherwise that dimension \u2264 3.\n- With single\u2011view evidence, set **confidence \u2264 3** and state limited evidence in the explanation.\n\nEditorial Minimal Safe\u2011Harbor:\n- If the page exhibits strong editorial minimal signals (e.g., stable multi\u2011column rhythm, tuned neutrals, disciplined micro\u2011labels, sparse accent use) and no red_flags are present, do not rate overall < 3.5 unless you list **\u22653 concrete defects across \u22652 dimensions**.\n\nConfidence Discipline:\n- If single\u2011view evidence or any red_flag is present \u2192 **overall_confidence \u2264 3** (prefer \u2264 2.5). Confidence should track evidence breadth and ambiguity.\n</evaluation_rules>\n\n<rubric>\n\n## Typography (weight = 35%)\n\n**Examine:**\nTypeface quality and appropriateness; pairing logic; hierarchy through scale/weight/spacing/tone (not just bold); readability (body **45\u201380 characters**, line height **1.3\u20131.7**, tighter for display without collisions); consistency (heading levels, lists, links including underline **thickness/offset**, baseline rhythm, quotes/apostrophes, superscript/subscript alignment, casing); micro\u2011craft (optical kerning in all\u2011caps, punctuation spacing, small\u2011caps quality, number alignment, rag/hyphen control).\n\nTypography scoring method (principled, non\u2011token):\n- Score the following sub\u2011factors 1\u20135 in your reasoning (keep JSON unchanged):\n  1) Hierarchy (multi\u2011modal: size + weight/spacing/tone)\n  2) Readability (measure/leading/contrast)\n  3) Consistency (scale steps, casing, labels, links/states across sections)\n  4) Micro\u2011craft (baseline rhythm, optical alignment, underline tuning, punctuation)\n- Weakest\u2011link soft cap: if any sub\u2011factor \u2264 2, **Typography \u2264 3** unless you present **\u22653 counter\u2011signals** addressing that sub\u2011factor across multiple sections.\n- Evidence ceiling: with single\u2011section evidence or missing state/link proof, **Typography \u2264 3**.\n- Anchor alignment: keep Typography within **\u00b10.5** of the nearest calibration anchor unless you list **\u22653 concrete deltas** explaining the difference inside the explanation.\n\n**Score 5 \u2014 Exceptional**\n\n* A minimal style set yields a rich, unmistakable hierarchy with impeccable rhythm across sections.\n* A single family or pairing is mastered; details are tuned (optical alignment, kerning, consistent ascender/cap spacing, intentional hyphenation, no widows/orphans, clean list indents).\n* A distinctive yet highly readable voice; links/labels are rigorously consistent, including states and edge cases.\n\n**Score 4 \u2014 Strong**\n\n* Clear hierarchy with restrained, consistent styles; measures and leading are comfortable across sections.\n* A visible scale system (e.g., modular ratios) spans multiple elements; link styling is customized and consistent or intentionally conservative.\n* **Common system faces can earn 4** when rhythm, measures, punctuation, casing, and link treatment are disciplined and repeat. Minor issues only.\n\n**Score 3 \u2014 Competent baseline**\n\n* Readable with adequate hierarchy using a limited style set; may feel generic.\n* Defaults (system sans + near\u2011default link blue) are acceptable but not broken.\n* Small inconsistencies may appear (close heading levels, uneven list indents, occasional baseline drift or widows/orphans, inconsistent smart quotes, one over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps, minor nav/hero mismatches).\n\n**Score 2 \u2014 Below average**\n\n* Multiple issues reduce clarity/polish: inconsistent casing; \u201ceverything bold\u201d; random word\u2011level bolding; emoji bullets that break rhythm; over\u2011indented lists; heavy dividers; random tracking or all\u2011caps; display/mono used for body; mixed fonts between buttons and body; default link styling with thick default underline; mixed link treatments; repeated widows/orphans or unstable baselines. Voice reads junior despite legibility.\n\n**Score 1 \u2014 Poor**\n\n* Flat or confusing hierarchy; style proliferation; unreadable measures (e.g., \\~90\u2013100ch hero); collisions/overlaps; inconsistent quotes/apostrophes; broken lists/labels.\n\n**Pull\u2011downs to 2 (or 1 if frequent):** default link blue with default underline; unreasoned serif/sans mixing; visible reflow collisions; mismatched button fonts or strokes; harsh, oversized nameplate in navigation.\n\n**Refined minimal vs generic minimal:**\n\n* **Refined**: tuned neutrals; customized underline weight/offset; disciplined scale steps; stable baselines; optical alignment of icons/marks; consistent micro\u2011labels/dates; intentional hyphenation; bullets align with text; consistent casing.\n* **Generic**: default link blue/underline; uneven paragraph spacing; arbitrary size jumps; mixed alignment without rationale; unmodified \u201cNotion\u2011export\u201d toggles/dividers; emoji bullets; oversized or over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; nav/hero compete for scale.\n\n---\n\n## Layout (weight = 35%)\n\n**Examine:**\nGrid usage (columns, gutters, container widths) and spacing system (multiples of 4/8/12); structural clarity (sections, scan paths, focal points, navigation affordances); image presentation (consistent crops, device\u2011frame consistency or bespoke mats, matched radii/borders/shadows, readable screenshots); innovation with control (novel structures that aid comprehension); breadth of evidence across sections and visible breakpoints.\n\n**Score 5 \u2014 Exceptional**\n\n* Masterful, point\u2011of\u2011view structure that elevates clarity while remaining disciplined.\n* Immaculate rhythm and alignment at visible breakpoints; optical fixes for asymmetric content; long, complex grids stay in sync.\n* Assets are harmonized (radii, borders, shadows, captions) with flawless consistency; even large galleries maintain exact mats/captions/gutters.\n\n**Score 4 \u2014 Strong**\n\n* Consistent grid and spacing; clear section hierarchy; strong alignment across sections.\n* Image/asset handling is deliberate and cohesive; cards/tiles feel unified.\n* Long repeated grids are disciplined (identical mats, radii, caption positions, gutter rhythm). Minor roughness is acceptable.\n* Uniform card grids may earn 4 only when mats/radii/spacing are notably refined and captions/labels are disciplined. Considered collage can also earn 4 when gutters, baselines, and captions repeat exactly and no crops are cut off.\n\n**Score 3 \u2014 Competent baseline**\n\n* A basic grid is present and mostly consistent; sections are readable with adequate spacing.\n* Common patterns (single column, centered hero, simple card grid, left\u2011text/right\u2011image hero) are executed decently but without a clear point of view.\n* Some inconsistencies may appear (gutters, container widths, vertical rhythm, image placement); device frames show light tuning.\n\n**Score 2 \u2014 Below average**\n\n* Structural problems: drifting container widths without rationale; unexplained switches between centered and left alignment; awkward rags; floaty calls to action that ignore the grid; masonry/collage tiles with inconsistent whitespace or cut\u2011off crops; small unreadable screenshots in generic device mocks; mixed tile ratios that cause rhythm flicker; inconsistent internal mats; oversized headings that overpower content; misaligned buttons/captions; billboard backgrounds crowd real content. Layout feels like an uncustomized template.\n\n**Score 1 \u2014 Poor**\n\n* Random placement; competing focal points; inconsistent widths/gutters; severe readability issues.\n* Haphazard screenshot handling; inconsistent radii/shadows; elements hug edges or overflow at visible breakpoints.\n\n**Common deductions and caps:**\n\n* Evidence limited to a **single hero or short view \u2192 cap at 3**, unless **Single\u2011view Pass** applies.\n* \u201cClean but generic\u201d templates (centered hero + simple grid with soft shadows/rounded corners and no point of view) should **not exceed 3** without visible refinement.\n* Repeated template modules with little customization: **cap at 3** and note **template scent high**.\n* If **\u22653 sloppy\u2011image cues** (cut\u2011offs, unreadable mocks, mixed radii/crops), **cap Layout at 2** and pull **Color** down when value flicker comes from mismatched whites/mats.\n\n---\n\n## Color (weight = 30%)\n\n**Examine:**\nPalette quality (harmony, hue/value control, consistency); neutrals (tuned grays/blacks, hue\u2011shifted borders/shadows, subtle overlays); accent strategy (sparseness and role clarity, link/call\u2011to\u2011action states); integration with imagery (does the shell unify diverse screenshots via mats, border tints, shadow logic, and sequencing).\n\n**Score 5 \u2014 Exceptional**\n\n* A sophisticated palette with precise value control; accents are sparse yet effective.\n* Neutrals and shadows are tuned; borders/overlays have intentional tints; varied content is unified effortlessly, including complex artwork.\n* Color expresses identity without noise and remains consistent across sections and states.\n\n**Score 4 \u2014 Strong**\n\n* A harmonious palette with controlled accents; link/call\u2011to\u2011action logic is clear or strongly implied by usage.\n* Neutrals are intentionally tuned (off\u2011black/off\u2011white) to support readability and hierarchy; gradients/illustrations sit comfortably within the system.\n* Conservative blue accents can still earn 4 when mats, borders, and grays are tuned and unify colorful content. Minor issues only.\n\n**Score 3 \u2014 Competent baseline**\n\n* A serviceable palette; the shell uses a single accent or default\u2011ish link blue acceptably.\n* When colorful tiles carry most color, the chrome does not clash but lacks unifying tactics that would lift it to 4.\n* States may be missing but are implied by stable patterns.\n\n**Score 2 \u2014 Below average**\n\n* Too many hues or values with little throughline; loud tiles overpower a claimed single\u2011accent scheme.\n* Flat, untuned grays; stark #000/#fff pairs; default bright link blue; inconsistent state colors.\n* Mixed tile backgrounds or mismatched whites cause grid flicker; full\u2011color social icons/client logos add noise; unnecessary colored outlines.\n* Pastel mats are attempted but overwhelmed by saturated foregrounds; value jumps (e.g., a saturated footer) break the page\u2019s structure.\n\n**Score 1 \u2014 Poor**\n\n* Clashing gradients; muddy overlays; illegible contrast; chaotic color with no role clarity.\n\n**Pull\u2011downs to 2:** pure #000/#fff with harsh default blue; mismatched tile backgrounds; muddy overlays; random hover colors; inconsistent visited link behavior; pastel mats that fail to unify saturated UIs; noisy social/logo rows; aggressive value jumps.\n\n**Tuned minimal vs default minimal:**\n\n* **Tuned**: slightly desaturated or hue\u2011shifted blue; consistent underline thickness/offset; hover/visited handled or implied; off\u2011black/off\u2011white neutrals; very light, even dividers; unified mats/shadows.\n* **Default**: pure black/white; harsh default blues; heavy generic shadows; inconsistent border tints; tile radii/shadows that do not match; multicolor logos/emoji adding noise.\n\n---\n\n# Red flags\n\nFlag these when clearly present and reflect them in explanations. Only add a flag when you can name at least two matching cues from the lists above; otherwise omit and reduce confidence.\n\n- template_scent_high:\n\n  - Obvious boilerplate patterns with minimal customization: centered \u201cI\u2019m [Name]\u201d hero with left text/right device, generic down arrow \u201cSee projects,\u201d uniform 2\u2011column rows with outline \u201cVIEW PROJECT\u201d buttons, billboard background words, stock \u201cAbout\u201d block, boilerplate footer, default link styles and underlines, visible \u201cMade with \u2026\u201d badge.\n  - Tokens that mirror popular UI kits without page\u2011level decisions: identical 12/16px radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues; identical card shadows; Inter/Roboto with untouched link defaults; Notion\u2011style layouts with unmodified toggles and dividers; emoji bullets as structure; oversized personal nameplate in nav.\n  - Repeated canned sections with identical structure, no bespoke visual decisions, and no tuning of mats, shadows, or link treatments; unexplained alternating center/left alignment and container widths that follow theme defaults.\n\n- sloppy_images:\n\n  - Inconsistent crops/aspect ratios; mixed/mismatched corner radii; aliasing/jaggies; compression artifacts; non\u2011retina blurriness; screenshots cut off or too zoomed out to read; tiny UI inside device frames.\n  - Generic device frames without customization; screenshots small/unreadable inside mocks; inconsistent mats/shadows/border weights; white\u2011balance mismatch across tiles; irregular masonry gutters.\n  - Misaligned captions/labels; inconsistent drop\u2011shadow directions; pixel wobble across a grid; outline/button strokes that do not match text weight; full\u2011color social/client logos used as graphic tiles without harmonization.\n\n- process_soup:\n  - Long timelines/diagrams overwhelming final visuals; walls of sticky\u2011note photos overshadowing product.\n  - Persona/journey maps with unreadable small text; very little outcome imagery; excessive wireframes with no polished result.\n\nNote: If uncertain, omit the flag and reduce confidence instead.
