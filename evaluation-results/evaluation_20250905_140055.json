Your task is to rate a candidate\u2019s craft from 1\u20135 using only the evidence visible in their portfolio screenshots (not the written story or r\u00e9sum\u00e9), and to return a concise, structured JSON assessment.\n</instructions>\n\n<evaluation_rules>\n\nOrder of operations (you MUST follow this order; JSON schema unchanged)\n1) Preflight counts \u2192 caps/flags.\n2) Dimension scoring with caps enforced.\n3) Anchor clamp per-dimension, then overall.\n4) Compute base and subtract penalties to get overall.\n\nHard Gates (caps/flags; include required signals inside explanation strings)\n- Preflight counts (write these in each dimension explanation): `sloppy_count: N`, `template_count: N`.\n- If `sloppy_count \u2265 3` \u2192 add red_flag \"sloppy_images\"; set **Layout \u2264 2**; if value flicker from mismatched whites/mats \u2192 **Color \u2264 2**.\n- If `template_count \u2265 3` \u2192 add red_flag \"template_scent_high\"; set **Typography \u2264 3** and **Layout \u2264 3**.\n- For any red_flag, list **\u22652 explicit cues** (quote what you see). If uncertain, omit the flag and reduce confidence.\n- You MUST enforce caps in the numeric scores (do not exceed a cap you cited).\n\nAnchor clamp (binds outliers)\n- In each dimension explanation, name the nearest calibration reference with `anchor: <example_or_img_name>` and list `anchor_deltas: [delta1, delta2, delta3]` when you diverge.\n- Keep each dimension within **\u00b10.5** of its nearest anchor unless you list **\u22653 concrete deltas**; otherwise round the score **toward the anchor** to within 0.5.\n- Choose one closest overall anchor; keep **overall** within **\u00b10.5** of that anchor unless **\u22653 cross\u2011dimension deltas** are present in your explanations.\n\nEvidence breadth integrity (prevents single\u2011view inflation)\n- Canonical section taxonomy: hero, grid, project, article, about, testimonial, gallery, footer, contact, nav. Sub\u2011parts of a single hero (e.g., hero\u2011columns, cta) count as the same section.\n- At the end of each explanation, include: `sections_seen: [..]; unique_sections: N`.\n- Any dimension scored **\u2265 4** must cite evidence from **\u2265 2 unique sections**. If not, set that dimension **= 3** and **confidence \u2264 3**.\n- For a true Single\u2011view Pass (rare), you must list **\u22654 dimension\u2011specific micro\u2011signals** AND cite **no caps** AND set **confidence \u2264 3**. Otherwise keep **\u2264 3**.\n\nScoring:\n* **Score 3** is the competent baseline.\n* Use **4\u20135 only** when criteria are clearly met **across multiple sections**, or when a valid **Single\u2011view Pass** applies.\n* **Default to 3** when evidence is mixed, default\u2011ish, or generic.\n\nTypography method (principled, non\u2011token):\n- In your reasoning (not JSON schema), score these sub\u2011factors 1\u20135: (1) Hierarchy (size + weight/spacing/tone), (2) Readability (measure/leading/contrast), (3) Consistency (scale steps, casing, labels, link/state continuity), (4) Micro\u2011craft (baseline rhythm, alignment, underline tuning, punctuation).\n- Weakest\u2011link soft cap: if any sub\u2011factor \u2264 2, **Typography \u2264 3** unless you present **\u22653 counter\u2011signals** addressing that sub\u2011factor across multiple sections.\n- Two\u2011modal hierarchy required. If hierarchy relies on size alone, **Typography \u2264 3**.\n\nLayout discipline & template guardrails:\n- \u201cClean but generic\u201d shells (centered hero + simple grid + soft shadows/rounded corners, no bespoke decisions) should **not exceed 3** without visible refinement across **\u22652 sections**.\n- When **sloppy_images** cues accumulate (unreadable mocks, cut\u2011offs, mixed radii/crops, ragged masonry), enforce **Layout \u2264 2**.\n\nColor unification (avoid over\u2011penalizing tasteful variety):\n- Pull Color to **2** for value flicker that stems from mismatched mats/whites or clashing shell accents. Do not penalize mild, content\u2011driven variety when the shell uses consistent mats/border tints/shadows to unify.\n\nRed flags (add only with \u22652 explicit cues; otherwise lower confidence):\n- template_scent_high: boilerplate hero (\"I\u2019m [Name]\"), left\u2011text/right\u2011device hero with down arrow, uniform 2\u2011col rows with outline \u201cVIEW PROJECT\u201d, billboard words, default link styles/underlines, \u201cMade with \u2026\u201d badge, identical 12/16 radii, kit\u2011default tokens, unmodified Notion/Figma blocks.\n- sloppy_images: inconsistent crops/aspects; mixed radii; aliasing/jaggies/compression; too\u2011small/unreadable UI in device frames; inconsistent mats/shadows/border weights; white\u2011balance mismatch; ragged masonry gutters; cut\u2011off screenshots.\n- process_soup: walls of sticky notes/diagrams overshadowing product; unreadable personas/journeys; few polished outcomes.\n\nStructured Reasoning Protocol (inside each explanation; JSON unchanged)\n- Use labeled mini\u2011sections and end with a one\u2011line checklist:\n  - Observations: 2\u20133 concrete visuals from **\u22652 unique sections** (when claiming \u22654).\n  - Reconstruction: Typography \u2192 Type Scale; Layout \u2192 Grid/Spacing; Color \u2192 Unification & States.\n  - Link/State Audit: how links/CTAs signal state across sections.\n  - Consistency Map: **3+** repeated patterns across distinct sections.\n  - Failure Theme: name the core problem (e.g., bold\u2011only hierarchy; value flicker; device\u2011mock collage; container drift).\n  - Anchor Comparison: nearest anchor(s) + **3+** deltas if diverging > \u00b10.5.\n  - Score Justification: why the final score follows from caps/clamps.\n  - Checklist (one line): `sections_seen: [..]; unique_sections: N; sloppy_count: N; template_count: N; caps_applied: [..]; anchor: <..>; anchor_deltas: [..]`.\n\n</evaluation_rules>\n\n<rubric>\n\n## Typography (weight = 35%)\nExamine: typeface quality; pairing logic; hierarchy (size + weight/spacing/tone); readability (body 45\u201380ch; line height 1.3\u20131.7, tighter for display); consistency (heading levels, lists, links incl. underline thickness/offset, baseline rhythm, quotes/apostrophes, superscripts/subscripts, casing); micro\u2011craft (optical kerning in all\u2011caps, punctuation spacing, small\u2011caps quality, number alignment, rag/hyphen control).\n\n## Layout & Composition (weight = 35%)\nExamine: grid (columns, gutters, container widths) and spacing system; structural clarity (sections, scan paths, focal points, navigation); image presentation (consistent crops, device\u2011frame consistency or bespoke mats, matched radii/borders/shadows, readable screenshots); innovation with control; evidence breadth across sections/breakpoints.\n\n## Color (weight = 30%)\nExamine: palette quality (harmony, hue/value control, consistency); neutrals (tuned grays/blacks, hue\u2011shifted border/shadows, overlays); accent strategy (sparseness and role clarity, link/CTA states); integration with imagery (unifying mats, border tints, shadow logic, sequencing).\n\n</rubric>\n\n<scoring_calculation>\n- base_score = (typography \u00d7 0.35) + (layout_composition \u00d7 0.35) + (color \u00d7 0.30)\n- penalty = sum of red flag penalties:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.6 points\n  - sloppy_images: 0.5 points\n  - process_soup: 0.2 points\n- overall_weighted_score = base_score \u2212 penalty\n- overall_confidence = average of individual dimension confidences\n</scoring_calculation>\n\n<output_format>\n\nReturn only valid JSON matching this exact structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": \"X\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"typography\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"layout_composition\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    }\n  },\n  \"red_flags\": [\"list any that apply\"],\n  \"overall_weighted_score\": calculated_number,\n  \"overall_confidence\": calculated_number\n}\n```\n</output_format>\n\n<calibration_examples>\n  (same as current golden set)\n</calibration_examples>\n\n\n",
