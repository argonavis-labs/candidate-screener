You must strictly evaluate the visual design quality without considering the content, where the person worked, or what companies/products are shown.\n\n## Evaluation Rules:\n\n1. **Score each dimension on a 1-5 scale** using the provided rubric anchors:\n   - 1: Terrible\n   - 2: Below average\n   - 3: Average\n   - 4: Above average\n   - 5: Fantastic\n\n2. **For each dimension, you MUST:**\n   - Provide a score (1-5)\n   - Write a detailed explanation of WHY you gave that score\n   - Cite specific visual evidence (e.g., \"inconsistent spacing between sections\", \"serif/sans-serif pairing creates strong hierarchy\")\n   - Rate your confidence in the score (1-5 scale where 1=very uncertain, 5=very confident)\n\n3. **Avoid context bias:**\n   - DO NOT be influenced by company names, logos, or prestigious brands shown\n   - DO NOT consider the actual content/copy of case studies\n   - DO NOT factor in where the person worked or what they worked on\n   - Focus ONLY on the visual execution and design craft\n\n4. **Be consistent in your evaluations:**\n   - Apply the rubric standards strictly and consistently across all evaluations\n   - Use the full 1-5 rating scale when warranted\n\n5. **Check for red flags** and list them if present:\n   - template_scent_high\n   - sloppy_images\n   - process_soup\n\n## Output Format:\n\nReturn **only** valid JSON matching this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": \"X\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"typography\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"layout_composition\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\", \n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    }\n  },\n  \"red_flags\": [\"list any that apply\"],\n  \"overall_weighted_score\": calculated_number,\n  \"overall_confidence\": calculated_number\n}\n```\n\n## Scoring Calculation:\n- base_score = (typography \u00d7 0.35) + (layout_composition \u00d7 0.35) + (color \u00d7 0.30)\n- penalty = sum of red flag penalties:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.5 points\n  - sloppy_images: 0.3 points\n  - process_soup: 0.2 points\n- overall_weighted_score = base_score - penalty  // scores can go below 0\n- overall_confidence = average of individual dimension confidences\n\n\n# RUBRIC (authoritative)\n\nThe rubric is the primary guide.

The small, rotated right-side nav uses a lighter, more compact style (likely a sans or lighter serif treatment) that creates a subtle secondary hierarchy without clutter.

          "explanation": "Strong two-column grid with consistent gutters and a repeated card component (uniform corner radius, shadow, and internal padding). Good vertical rhythm and generous white space around the hero and between sections. The colored header area within each card ties disparate screenshots together, creating cohesion. CTA section at the bottom aligns nicely and provides a clear visual break. Minor critiques: the masonry heights create a slightly busy zig-zag flow; a couple of screenshot crops sit a bit tight against the colored block edges compared to others, introducing small inconsistencies in internal margins.",

The palette is harmonious across yellow, orange, purple, green, teal, and pink\u2014kept cohesive through similar saturation and lightness. Color is used meaningfully to group and frame work, not everywhere. Shadows are soft and not overly dark, fitting the light aesthetic. Minor nit: the brighter yellow/orange accents pull slightly more attention than the cooler pastels, causing uneven emphasis across the grid.",

          "explanation": "Clear, restrained system using a single modern sans-serif with thoughtful weight changes (extra-bold hero, regular body, medium labels). Hierarchy is strong: oversized headline, smaller muted intro, then project titles and short descriptions. Micro-typography is tidy: small-caps/uppercase tags with slight tracking, compact nav, and consistent left alignment below the hero. Line length is generally comfortable, though the hero subcopy and some one-line project descriptions run a bit wide, and the light gray body text approaches low contrast in spots. No chaotic mixing of typefaces or arbitrary alignment shifts.",

Each project block follows the same pattern: a large screenshot on a soft gray panel with rounded corners and diffuse shadow, followed by a label, title, and a short line\u2014this repetition ties the page together. Alignment is disciplined (left-aligned section, right-aligned 'see all' link balancing the row). Visual devices (angled screenshots, overlapping windows, device mock) add variety while maintaining cohesion via identical framing, padding, and corner radii. Nothing feels cramped or randomly placed.",

          "explanation": "Sophisticated restraint: primarily white and soft grays with dark navy text, plus two controlled accents (a warm coral in the logo/CTA and a cool blue for labels). Accents are sparingly applied and help hierarchy without overwhelming. Shadows are soft and cool-tinted, matching the overall palette and avoiding default harshness. Minor note: using both coral and blue as accents slightly splits the accent language; consolidating to one could increase cohesion further.",
