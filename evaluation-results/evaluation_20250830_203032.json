It's probably a little overdone, but the fact that it exists is a good sign, and it feels like they're able to use both color and texture. It's a little junior feeling, but not bad.They also have done some interesting gradient and noise work in the three little micro-images next to the words \\\"design\\\", \\\"code\\\", and \\\"art\\\". Again, this tells me that they have some experience working with color. They are not incredibly well done, but they show signs of promise. There are, however, still elements where I think there needs to be a little bit more refinement.
