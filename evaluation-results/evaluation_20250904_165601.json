  "full_prompt_used": "# EVALUATION PROMPT\n\nYou are a senior product design hiring manager evaluating portfolio websites based on visual craft only. Judge only what is visible in the provided page(s)/images. Do not infer quality from brands, content, or reputation.\n\n## Evaluation Rules\n\n1. Scoring posture (critical, calibrated, and specific):\n   - Default anchor is 3 (Average/Competent). Start every dimension at 3 when the work is readable and basically organized, then move up or down strictly on visible evidence.\n   - Be skeptical of \u201ctidy but generic.\u201d If you note default link styles, stock modules, mixed alignments, or more than one small inconsistency, round down rather than up.\n   - Do not award 4\u20135 for \u201cneat\u201d or \u201cnot broken.\u201d Scores 4\u20135 require visible refinement across multiple sections and/or a distinctive, coherent point of view that improves clarity and cohesion.\n   - Evidence\u2011limited views: When only a single hero or single section is visible, cap each dimension at 3 unless either the Minimalism Micro\u2011Craft Check or the Elevated Basics Check passes (see Rule 2). Never award 5 without multiple sections, or unless the visible section shows unmistakable master\u2011level micro\u2011craft.\n   - Caps from red flags apply (see Rules 7 and 9). Template scent without strong counter\u2011evidence caps Typography and Layout at 3. Three or more sloppy image cues cap Layout at 2 and can pull Color to 2 when mismatched mats/whites cause flicker.\n\n2. Two ways a single refined view can justify a 4 (you must explicitly verify the signals):\n   - Minimalism Micro\u2011Craft Check (pass when \u22654 signals are present):\n     - Tuned neutrals (off\u2011black/off\u2011white; borders/shadows show hue shifts and controlled values).\n     - Customized link styling (non\u2011default hue and underline thickness/offset; clear hover or convincingly consistent implied state).\n     - Measured typographic rhythm (predictable ratio steps; stable baseline; no widows/orphans; intentional hyphenation and rags; consistent punctuation and casing).\n     - Intentional spacing system (e.g., 4/8/12 multiples; even row rhythm; no accidental half\u2011gutter gaps).\n     - Optical alignment corrections (icons aligned to x\u2011height/caps; bullets/dividers centered optically; numerals/symbols sit correctly).\n     - Hierarchy achieved with minimal styles (tone/weight/spacing) yet unambiguous; labels/meta styles repeat exactly.\n     - Disciplined image/list presentation (matching aspect ratios, radii, mats, caption positions; no random white balances; no emoji bullets or novelty icons as structure).\n     - Cohesive bespoke touches (e.g., editorial serif paired with care; caret/arrow icons aligned to cap height; button strokes that match surrounding type weight; no default blue).\n   - Elevated Basics Check (for default\u2011leaning but tuned designs; pass when \u22655 signals are present):\n     - Comfortable measures (45\u201380ch body) and consistent 1.3\u20131.7 leading; display leading tighter but non\u2011colliding.\n     - Consistent link treatment even if conservative; underline weight/offset intentional; states visible or plausibly consistent.\n     - Neutrals feel considered (soft grey dividers, off\u2011black text); no harsh pure #000/#fff pairs; shadows/borders with subtle tints.\n     - Repetition handled with discipline (long card/icon grids keep identical mats, radii, border weights, caption rhythm).\n     - Clear text scale system (predictable size/weight steps) repeated across sections; punctuation/quotes consistent; no random bolding to simulate hierarchy.\n     - Accents are sparse and role\u2011clear; imagery carries color without clashing; mats/borders unify diverse screenshots.\n     - No sloppy artifacts (no jaggies/compression; crops and radii match; consistent shadow/border logic; no unreadable screenshots; device frames avoided or customized with readable content).\n\n3. Score each dimension on a 1\u20135 scale:\n   - 1: Poor\n   - 2: Below average\n   - 3: Average (competent baseline)\n   - 4: Strong (refined and intentional)\n   - 5: Exceptional (rare, masterful, and original)\n\n4. For each dimension, you MUST:\n   - Provide a score (1\u20135).\n   - Write a concise explanation citing at least 3 concrete visual observations (e.g., \u201ceven 56\u201364ch measure,\u201d \u201cunderline offset aligns to x\u2011height,\u201d \u201ctile radii unified at 12px; borders 1px with subtle hue shift,\u201d \u201cdevice mock crops cut off status bar,\u201d \u201ccenter/left alignment alternates without grid reason\u201d).\n   - Call out at least one limitation, even for scores \u22654, to avoid uncritical praise.\n   - Rate your confidence (1\u20135). If evidence is partial (e.g., only a hero or one section), set confidence \u22643.\n\n5. Avoid context bias:\n   - Ignore brands, company names, and content substance.\n   - Evaluate only visible visual execution and design craft.\n\n6. Be consistent with exemplars:\n   - Use exemplar ratings as calibration anchors.\n   - Apply the same standard across evaluations. Minimal, text\u2011forward pages can earn 4\u20135 when micro\u2011craft is clearly elevated (see Rule 2), especially when large, repeated grids show flawless rhythm and alignment across sections.\n   - Important: \u201cGallery/collage\u201d layouts may be strong when variation is obviously intentional and rhythm is controlled (consistent caption system, repeatable gutters/mats, optical alignment). Do not punish considered variation; punish sloppy inconsistency.\n\n7. Check for red flags and list them when present:\n   - template_scent_high\n   - sloppy_images\n   - process_soup\n   - When you flag any red flag, cite at least two matching cues from the lists in Rule 9 in your explanations. Apply the related caps and be conservative with scores.\n\n8. Innovation vs. basic competence:\n   - Do not award 4\u20135 for centered heroes, uniform grids, outline \u201cVIEW PROJECT\u201d buttons, or tidy device\u2011mock rows if they feel boilerplate or default. \u201cLooks fine\u201d is a 3.\n   - Reward originality only when it improves comprehension and is executed with control (alignment, rhythm, hierarchy, and color remain strong). Subtle, disciplined systems that unify complex, varied imagery can be exceptional even with minimal styling.\n\n9. Quick template and sloppiness scan (use to inform red flags and to avoid overrating):\n   - Template scent visual cues (3+ suggests template_scent_high and cap Typography/Layout at 3 unless strong counter\u2011evidence exists):\n     - Copy\u2011paste tokens from UI kits: identical 12/16px radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues/purples; default Inter/Roboto link blue with default underline/visited purple.\n     - Stock hero patterns: \u201cI\u2019m [Name] \u2026\u201d or \u201cHi, I\u2019m \u2026\u201d headline; centered \u201cdon\u2019t be a stranger\u201d footer; \u201cSee projects\u201d down arrow; oversized personal nameplate in nav competing with hero.\n     - Uncustomized layout modules: left text/right device hero; alternating light/dark bands; uniform 2\u2011column case rows with identical outline \u201cVIEW\u201d buttons; centered \u201cCASE STUDIES\u201d label above left\u2011aligned content; boilerplate footer; \u201cMade with Framer/Webflow\u201d badge.\n     - Notion/Figma\u2011like blocks with unmodified dividers/toggles; generic device frames; cookie\u2011cutter badges/pill buttons with identical shadows; random handwriting doodle paired with default UI.\n     - Unexplained switches between center/left alignment and inconsistent container widths that mirror theme defaults rather than page\u2011level decisions.\n     - Background billboard words as filler; logos band with mixed sizes/colors acting as a section substitute.\n     - Note: Do not flag solely for a centered hero and grid if there is clear bespoke tuning (consistent mats, tuned neutrals, customized links, optical alignment). Require 3+ concrete cues before flagging.\n   - Sloppy execution cues (2+ suggests sloppy_images or pull scores down; if 3+ are present, cap Layout at 2 and consider Color 2 when mats/whites flicker):\n     - Inconsistent crops/aspect ratios; mixed or mismatched corner radii; aliasing/jaggies; compression or non\u2011retina blur; screenshots too zoomed out to read; device mock content illegible.\n     - Mixed device frames (phone/laptop/desktop) that dominate while diminishing readability; screenshots cut off or with thick internal mats that vary.\n     - Shadow/border values fluctuate without logic; captions misaligned to tiles; stray 1\u20132px misalignments repeated; pixel wobble across grids; outline/button stroke weights that don\u2019t match body text weight.\n     - Masonry grids with irregular whitespace or gutters; logos or social icons oversized or full\u2011color in otherwise minimal sections; colored outlines around low\u2011priority elements drawing attention without purpose.\n   - Process soup cues:\n     - Long walls of sticky notes, personas, or unreadable timelines dominating above final visuals; deliverables with tiny text that cannot be evaluated; few or no polished product shots.\n\n10. Execution checklist before scoring (to sharpen critique and reduce leniency):\n   - Typography:\n     - Verify capitalization and casing consistency (nav vs headings vs labels; sentence case vs Title Case); inconsistent sentence starts are a deduction.\n     - Look for random tracking/over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; avoid \u201ceverything bold\u201d or excessive bolding inside paragraphs to force emphasis.\n     - Identify vertical divider abuse (dividers taller/heavier than adjacent text), emoji as bullets, over\u2011indented lists, and sloppy rags/widows/orphans.\n     - Link treatment: hue, underline thickness/offset, visited/hover cues; penalize default blue with default underline.\n     - Pairing logic: avoid display/editorial or monospace for body; detect mixed fonts in buttons vs body; ensure button stroke weights match type weight.\n     - Confirm measure/leading (45\u201380ch; 1.3\u20131.7); flag heroes exceeding ~90ch as too long.\n   - Layout & Composition:\n     - Grid/gutter consistency; container width logic across sections (nav vs hero vs body). Penalize drift such as wide nav \u2192 narrow hero \u2192 wider body with no rationale.\n     - Alignment discipline: avoid unjustified center/left switches; detect rag/edge drift that makes same\u2011width sections read as mismatched; note floaty CTAs.\n     - Image framing: mats, border weights, corner radii; detect generic device mocks and small unreadable screenshots; ensure no crops are cut off.\n     - Repetition checks: identical caption positions and offsets; consistent tile aspect ratios; beware irregular masonry or collage with flickering whitespace.\n   - Color:\n     - Tuned neutrals vs harsh #000/#fff; accent role clarity and consistency; link/CTA state logic.\n     - Unification tactics: mats/borders/shadow tints that harmonize diverse imagery; avoid bright footers or tiles that jump in value and break the system.\n     - Penalize noisy additions: full\u2011color social/client logos in minimal shells; colored outlines around icons/logos; pastel mats that fail to tame saturated UI.\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn only valid JSON matching this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": \"X\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"typography\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"layout_composition\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    }\n  },\n  \"red_flags\": [\"list any that apply\"],\n  \"overall_weighted_score\": calculated_number,\n  \"overall_confidence\": calculated_number\n}\n```\n\n## Scoring Calculation\n- base_score = (typography \u00d7 0.35) + (layout_composition \u00d7 0.35) + (color \u00d7 0.30)\n- penalty = sum of red flag penalties:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.6 points\n  - sloppy_images: 0.5 points\n  - process_soup: 0.2 points\n- overall_weighted_score = base_score - penalty\n- overall_confidence = average of individual dimension confidences\n\n---\n\n## RUBRIC\n\nFollow this rubric strictly. The \u201cScore 3\u201d rows define the competent baseline. Use 4\u20135 only when criteria are clearly met across multiple sections, or when a single view passes Rule 2. Default to 3 when evidence is mixed, default\u2011ish, or generic.\n\n## Typography (Weight: 35%)\n\nWhat to examine (look closely and cite specifics):\n- Typeface quality (pro\u2011grade vs overused free), appropriateness, and pairing logic.\n- Hierarchy via scale ratios, weight, spacing, and tone\u2014not only bolding.\n- Readability: body 45\u201380ch; line\u2011height 1.3\u20131.7; display sizes tighter leading without collisions.\n- Consistency: heading levels, list styles, link treatment (underline thickness/offset), baseline rhythm, quote punctuation and apostrophes, superscripts/subscripts alignment, casing/capitalization patterns.\n- Micro\u2011craft: optical kerning for all\u2011caps; punctuation spacing; small\u2011caps quality; number alignment; hyphenation/rag control.\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- A minimal style set produces rich, unmistakable hierarchy with impeccable rhythm across sections.\n- Pairing (or single family) shows mastery; details tuned (optical alignment, kerning, consistent cap/ascender spacing; intentional hyphenation; no widows/orphans; bullets align; lists indent cleanly).\n- Distinctive typographic voice that feels bespoke yet highly readable. Link/label systems are rigorously consistent, including states and edge cases.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Clear hierarchy with restrained, consistent styles; comfortable measures and leading across sections.\n- Evident scale system (e.g., modular ratios) across multiple elements; link styling is customized and consistent or convincingly intentional even when conservative.\n- Elevated basics allowed: a common system sans/serif can earn 4 if rhythm, measures, punctuation, casing, and link treatment are disciplined and repeat.\n- Minor issues only (e.g., a slightly hot link hue, one tight display line, a narrow rag).\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline\n- Readable with adequate hierarchy and a limited style set; may feel generic.\n- Choices can be default\u2011ish (system sans + near\u2011default link blue) but aren\u2019t broken.\n- Some inconsistencies: heading levels too close; uneven bullet spacing/indentation; occasional baseline drift; a widow/orphan; inconsistent smart quotes; one instance of over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; small nav/hero mismatches kept in check.\n\nScore 2: Below average\n- Multiple issues that reduce polish and clarity:\n  - Inconsistent capitalization/casing across similar elements or sentences; \u201ceverything bold\u201d effect; random word\u2011level bolding to force emphasis.\n  - Emoji used as bullets creating irregular indents/line height; over\u2011indented lists; tall/heavy vertical dividers that overpower labels.\n  - Random tracking or overuse of all\u2011caps; display/editorial or monospace used for body; mixed font in CTAs/buttons vs body.\n  - Link styling clearly default with thick default underline; mixed link treatments; no visible state logic.\n  - Repeated widows/orphans, sloppy rags, or unstable baselines across sections.\n- Voice reads generic or junior despite basic legibility.\n\nScore 1: Poor\n- Flat or confusing hierarchy; style proliferation; unreadable measures (very long/very tight lines, e.g., hero ~90\u2013100ch); collisions/overlaps; inconsistent quotes/apostrophes and punctuation; numerous broken lists/labels.\n\nNegative indicators that should pull to 2 (or 1 when frequent):\n- Default link blue with default underline and no tuning; mixed serif/sans without logic; visible reflow collisions; inconsistent quotation marks/apostrophes; mismatched button font/outline; button stroke weights that don\u2019t match text; oversized nameplate in nav.\n\nHow to distinguish refined minimal vs generic minimal type:\n- Refined: tuned neutrals; customized underline weight/offset; disciplined scale steps; stable baselines; optical alignment of icons/marks; consistent micro\u2011labels and dates; intentional hyphenation; bullets align neatly with text blocks; casing consistently applied.\n- Generic: default link blue and underline; uneven paragraph spacing; arbitrary size jumps; mixed alignment without rationale; \u201cNotion export\u201d vibes with unmodified toggles/dividers; emoji bullets; oversized or over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; nav/hero sizing competition.\n\n## Layout & Composition (Weight: 35%)\n\nWhat to examine:\n- Grid usage: columns, gutters, container widths; spacing system (multiples of 4/8/12).\n- Structural clarity: section breaks, scan patterns, focal points, navigation affordances.\n- Image presentation: consistent crops, device\u2011frame consistency or bespoke mats; matching radii/border weights/shadows; readable screenshots.\n- Innovation with control: novel structures that aid comprehension; restraint that still shows a point of view.\n- Breadth of evidence: multiple sections vs single hero; consistency across the page and at visible breakpoints.\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Masterful structure with a clear POV that elevates clarity (inventive yet disciplined layouts, precise orchestration across columns/sections).\n- Immaculate rhythm and alignment at visible breakpoints; optical fixes for asymmetric content; complex, long grids stay perfectly in sync.\n- Assets are harmonized (radii, borders, shadows, captions) with flawless consistency across diverse content; complex grids remain legible and elegant. Minimal pages with large, repeated galleries can earn 5 when mats/captions/gutters are exact.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Consistent grid and spacing; clear section hierarchy; strong alignment across sections.\n- Image/asset handling is deliberate and cohesive; cards/tiles feel unified and intentional.\n- Long repeated grids are disciplined (identical mats, radii, caption positions, gutter rhythm).\n- Minor roughness allowed (one floaty element, a narrow gutter anomaly, or a single misaligned caption corrected elsewhere).\n- Important: Uniform card grids can earn 4 only when mats/radii/spacing are notably refined and captions/labels are disciplined. Otherwise default to 3.\n- Considered collage is acceptable: variable tile sizes may earn 4 when gutters, baselines, and caption styles repeat exactly and no crops are cut off.\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline\n- Basic grid present and mostly consistent; sections are readable with adequate spacing.\n- Common patterns (single column, centered hero, simple card grid, left\u2011text/right\u2011image hero) executed decently but without sophistication or a clear POV.\n- Some inconsistencies in gutters, container widths, vertical rhythm, or image placement; default device frames with light tuning.\n\nScore 2: Below average\n- Noticeable structural problems:\n  - Container width drift across sections (e.g., wide nav \u2192 narrow hero \u2192 wide body) with no rationale, or perceived width mismatches caused by ragged edges or off\u2011grid content.\n  - Unexplained switches between center and left alignment; awkward rags; floaty CTAs not tied to grid.\n  - Masonry or collage tiles with inconsistent whitespace; irregular bottoms/tops; crops cut off.\n  - Reliance on generic device mocks where screenshots are small/unreadable; mixed tile aspect ratios produce rhythm flicker; inconsistent internal mats.\n  - Oversized headings/labels that overpower content; misaligned buttons/captions; billboard background words crowding real content.\n- Layout reads like an uncustomized template or a pile of modules.\n\nScore 1: Poor\n- Random placement; competing focal points; inconsistent container widths and gutters; severe readability issues.\n- Haphazard screenshot handling; inconsistent radii/shadows; elements hugging edges or overflowing at visible breakpoints.\n\nCommon deductions and caps:\n- Evidence limited to a single hero or short view: cap at 3 unless Rule 2 passes.\n- \u201cClean but generic\u201d: centered hero + simple grid with soft shadows/rounded corners and no POV\u2014do not exceed 3 without visible refinement (precise rhythm, tuned mats, optical alignment).\n- Template modules repeated with little customization: cap at 3 and consider template_scent_high.\n- If sloppy_images cues \u22653 (cut\u2011offs, unreadable device mocks, mixed radii/crops), cap Layout at 2 and pull Color down when grid flicker is caused by mismatched whites/mats.\n\n## Color (Weight: 30%)\n\nWhat to examine:\n- Palette quality: harmony, hue/value control, and consistency across sections.\n- Neutrals: tuned greys/blacks; hue\u2011shifted borders and shadows; subtle overlays.\n- Accent strategy: scarcity and consistency; link/CTA states; role clarity.\n- Integration with imagery: does the shell unify diverse screenshots/tiles (mats, border tints, shadow logic, sequencing)?\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Sophisticated palette with precise value control; accents sparse yet highly effective.\n- Neutrals and shadows are tuned; borders/overlays have intentional tints; color choices unify varied content effortlessly, including complex artwork.\n- Color expresses identity without noise, consistently across sections and states.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Harmonious palette with controlled accents; link/CTA system clearly defined or convincingly implied by consistent usage.\n- Neutrals intentionally tuned (off\u2011black/off\u2011white) supporting readability and hierarchy; gradients/illustrations sit comfortably within the system.\n- Elevated basics acceptable: conservative blue accent can qualify for 4 when mats, borders, and greys are tuned and unify colorful content.\n- Minor issues only (one accent slightly hot, a single mismatched gradient, a bright footer that is close to acceptable, or limited state evidence).\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline\n- Serviceable palette; minimal shell with a single accent or defaultish link blue used acceptably.\n- When colorful tiles carry most color, the chrome does not clash but lacks unifying tactics (e.g., inconsistent mats/shadows/border tints) that would lift it to 4.\n- States may be missing but implied by stable patterns.\n\nScore 2: Below average\n- Too many hues or values with little throughline; loud tiles overpower a claimed single\u2011accent scheme.\n- Flat untuned greys; harsh #000/#fff pairs; default bright link blue; inconsistent state colors.\n- Mixed tile backgrounds and mismatched whites causing grid flicker; full\u2011color social icons or client logos add unnecessary noise; colored outlines around low\u2011importance elements.\n- Pastel mats attempted but overwhelmed by saturated foreground content; jumpy sections like a saturated footer that breaks the page\u2019s value structure.\n\nScore 1: Poor\n- Clashing gradients; muddy overlays; illegible contrast; chaotic use of color without role clarity.\n\nNegative indicators that should pull to 2:\n- Pure #000/#fff with harsh 0,0,255\u2011like blue; mismatched tile backgrounds; muddy overlays; random hover colors; inconsistent visited link behavior; pastel mats that fail to unify because foreground UIs are extremely saturated; social logo rows or multicolor client badges pulling attention without purpose; aggressive value jumps (e.g., cobalt footer shock).\n\nHow to spot tuned vs default color in minimal pages:\n- Tuned: slightly desaturated or hue\u2011shifted blue; consistent underline thickness/offset; hover/visited handled or implied by pattern; off\u2011black/off\u2011white neutrals; very light, even dividers; unified mats/shadows around images.\n- Default: pure black/white; harsh default blues; generic heavy shadows; inconsistent border tints; tiles with different corner radii or shadow directions; color\u2011heavy logos/emoji adding noise.\n\n## Red Flags\n\nFlag these when clearly present and reflect them in explanations. Only add a flag when you can name at least two matching cues from the lists above; otherwise omit and reduce confidence.\n\n- template_scent_high:\n  - Obvious boilerplate patterns with minimal customization: centered \u201cI\u2019m [Name]\u201d hero with left text/right device, generic down arrow \u201cSee projects,\u201d uniform 2\u2011column rows with outline \u201cVIEW PROJECT\u201d buttons, billboard background words, stock \u201cAbout\u201d block, boilerplate footer, default link styles and underlines, visible \u201cMade with \u2026\u201d badge.\n  - Tokens that mirror popular UI kits without page\u2011level decisions: identical 12/16px radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues; identical card shadows; Inter/Roboto with untouched link defaults; Notion\u2011style layouts with unmodified toggles and dividers; emoji bullets as structure; oversized personal nameplate in nav.\n  - Repeated canned sections with identical structure, no bespoke visual decisions, and no tuning of mats, shadows, or link treatments; unexplained alternating center/left alignment and container widths that follow theme defaults.\n\n- sloppy_images:\n  - Inconsistent crops/aspect ratios; mixed/mismatched corner radii; aliasing/jaggies; compression artifacts; non\u2011retina blurriness; screenshots cut off or too zoomed out to read; tiny UI inside device frames.\n  - Generic device frames without customization; screenshots small/unreadable inside mocks; inconsistent mats/shadows/border weights; white\u2011balance mismatch across tiles; irregular masonry gutters.\n  - Misaligned captions/labels; inconsistent drop\u2011shadow directions; pixel wobble across a grid; outline/button strokes that do not match text weight; full\u2011color social/client logos used as graphic tiles without harmonization.\n\n- process_soup:\n  - Long timelines/diagrams overwhelming final visuals; walls of sticky\u2011note photos overshadowing product.\n  - Persona/journey maps with unreadable small text; very little outcome imagery; excessive wireframes with no polished result.\n\nNote: If uncertain, omit the flag and reduce confidence instead. If you do flag, list the cues you observed in your explanations.",

Vertical rhythm is measured\u2014generous section spacing and consistent container width keep scan predictable; project images fill the content column with matching margins. Hero uses considered asymmetry (calligraphic mark and circular motif) without breaking the grid, and the dark footer grid resolves the page with clear structure. Limitation: image treatments vary (e.g., angled collage for Airbase, very dark Blitz mock, mixed window/device frames) which weakens cohesion compared to a fully unified tile system.",

          "explanation": "Palette leans on tuned neutrals: warm off\u2011white background, off\u2011black type, and subtle beige textures that sit quietly behind the work. Color is carried mainly by the project imagery; despite varied hues (purples, blues, dark UIs), the neutral shell keeps the page harmonious. The dark navy/charcoal footer creates a deliberate value shift that still feels part of the system. Limitation: no clearly defined accent/CTA color system or visible states; a couple saturated gradients rely solely on the image without unifying mats/borders, which slightly reduces cohesion.",
