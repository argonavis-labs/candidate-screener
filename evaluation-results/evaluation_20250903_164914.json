  "full_prompt_used": "# EVALUATION PROMPT\n\nYou are a senior product design hiring manager evaluating portfolio websites based on visual craft only. Judge what you can see on the page(s)/images provided. Do not infer quality from brands, content, or reputation.\n\n## Evaluation Rules\n\n1. Scoring posture (critical but fair):\n   - Use the full 1\u20135 range. A 3 (Average/Competent) is the baseline for solid but unremarkable work.\n   - 4\u20135 require clear evidence of refinement and originality beyond \u201cnot broken.\u201d\n   - Evidence-limited views: If only a single hero/section is visible, default-cap at 3. You may award 4 if the \u201cMinimalism Exception Check\u201d passes (see below). Only award 5 with multiple sections, or if the visible section demonstrates unmistakably masterful micro-craft.\n\n2. Minimalism Exception Check (allow a 4 on a single refined view when \u22655 signals are present):\n   - Tuned neutrals (not pure #000/#fff); borders/shadows tinted and value-controlled.\n   - Link styling is customized (non-default hue/value, underline thickness/offset tuned, consistent hover state).\n   - Measured typographic rhythm (consistent ratio steps, stable baseline, no widows/orphans).\n   - Intentional spacing system visible (e.g., 8/12/16 multiples consistently applied; even row rhythm).\n   - Optical alignment corrections (icons sit on baseline/caps height; list bullets/markers aligned; dividers centered optically).\n   - Hierarchy achieved with minimal styles (color/weight/spacing) yet unambiguous.\n   - Image or list presentation is disciplined (matching aspect ratios, radii, mats, caption alignment).\n   - Page-level voice is distinctive despite restraint (e.g., editorial serif used with control; subtle bespoke details).\n\n3. Score each dimension on a 1\u20135 scale:\n   - 1: Poor\n   - 2: Below average\n   - 3: Average (competent baseline)\n   - 4: Strong (refined and intentional)\n   - 5: Exceptional (rare, masterful, and original)\n\n4. For each dimension, you MUST:\n   - Provide a score (1\u20135).\n   - Write a concise explanation citing at least 3 concrete visual observations (e.g., \u201cconsistent 8/12/20 spacing ladder,\u201d \u201cunderline offset matches x-height,\u201d \u201ctile radii unified at 12px; shadows 0/1/2px with hue shift\u201d).\n   - Call out at least one limitation even for scores \u22654 to avoid uncritical praise.\n   - Rate your confidence (1\u20135). If evidence is partial (e.g., only a hero or one section), set confidence \u22643.\n\n5. Avoid context bias:\n   - Ignore brands, company names, and content substance.\n   - Evaluate only visual execution and design craft that is visible.\n\n6. Be consistent with exemplars:\n   - Use exemplar ratings as calibration anchors.\n   - Apply the same standards across all evaluations. Minimal, text\u2011forward pages can earn 4 when micro\u2011craft is clearly elevated (see Minimalism Exception Check).\n\n7. Check for red flags and list them when present:\n   - template_scent_high\n   - sloppy_images\n   - process_soup\n\n8. Innovation vs. basic competence:\n   - Do not award 4\u20135 for merely clean, centered layouts or uniform card grids.\n   - Reward originality only when it is executed with control and improves clarity. Minimal originality can qualify if manifested through disciplined micro\u2011craft and a coherent point of view.\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn only valid JSON matching this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": \"X\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"typography\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"layout_composition\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    }\n  },\n  \"red_flags\": [\"list any that apply\"],\n  \"overall_weighted_score\": calculated_number,\n  \"overall_confidence\": calculated_number\n}\n```\n\n## Scoring Calculation\n- base_score = (typography \u00d7 0.35) + (layout_composition \u00d7 0.35) + (color \u00d7 0.30)\n- penalty = sum of red flag penalties:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.5 points\n  - sloppy_images: 0.3 points\n  - process_soup: 0.2 points\n- overall_weighted_score = base_score - penalty  // scores can go below 0\n- overall_confidence = average of individual dimension confidences\n\n---\n\n# RUBRIC\n\nFollow this rubric strictly. The \u201cScore 3\u201d rows define the competent baseline. Use 4\u20135 only when criteria are clearly met across multiple sections, or when a single view passes the Minimalism Exception Check.\n\n## Typography (Weight: 35%)\n\nWhat to examine (look closely and cite specifics):\n- Typeface quality (pro-grade vs overused free); appropriateness and pairing logic.\n- Hierarchy executed via scale ratios, weight, spacing, and color\u2014not only bolding.\n- Readability: line length 45\u201380ch; line-height 1.3\u20131.7 for body; display sizes have measured tighter leading without collisions.\n- Consistency: heading levels, list styles, link treatment (underline thickness/offset), baseline rhythm.\n- Micro-craft: optical kerning for all-caps, punctuation/quotes balance, superscripts/subscripts alignment, small-caps quality.\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Minimal style set generates rich, unmistakable hierarchy with impeccable rhythm across sections.\n- Pairing (or single family) shows mastery; details tuned (optical alignment, kerning, consistent cap/ascender spacing).\n- Distinctive typographic voice that feels bespoke yet highly readable. No widows/orphans; link/label systems are meticulously consistent.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Clear hierarchy with restrained, consistent style usage; comfortable measures.\n- Thoughtful scale system (e.g., modular ratio) visible in multiple elements; link styling customized and consistent.\n- Minor issues only (e.g., slightly tight display leading or small contrast gap). A minimal, single\u2011style approach can earn 4 if micro\u2011craft signals are strong and consistent.\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline\n- Readable with acceptable hierarchy and a limited style set.\n- Choices may feel defaultish (system sans + defaultish link blue) but not broken.\n- Small inconsistencies (e.g., heading levels close together, uneven list/bullet spacing, occasional baseline drift) prevent refinement.\n\nScore 1\u20132: Weak/Poor\n- Style proliferation (too many sizes/weights) or flat hierarchy; random alignments.\n- Problematic measures (very long lines with airy leading, or cramped body); glaring widows/orphans.\n- Low-quality or clashing fonts; mismatched display/body pairing.\n\nCommon deductions:\n- All-italic long paragraphs; unreadable contrast; mixed link styles within the view; superscripts crowding punctuation; inconsistent date/label treatments.\n\nHow to distinguish generic vs refined minimal type:\n- Refined: tuned neutrals, customized link underline, disciplined scale steps, stable baselines, optical alignment of icons/marks.\n- Generic: default link blue and underline, uneven paragraph spacing, arbitrary size jumps, mixed alignment without rationale.\n\n## Layout & Composition (Weight: 35%)\n\nWhat to examine:\n- Grid usage: columns, gutters, container widths; spacing system (multiples of 4/8/12).\n- Structural clarity: section breaks, scan patterns, focal points, navigation affordances.\n- Image presentation: consistent crops, device-frame consistency or bespoke mats, matching radii/border weights/shadows.\n- Innovation with control: novel structures that aid comprehension; restraint that still shows a point of view.\n- Evidence breadth: multiple sections vs single hero; consistency across the page.\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Masterful structure with a clear POV that elevates clarity (e.g., inventive yet disciplined layouts, precise orchestration across columns/sections).\n- Immaculate rhythm and alignment at all visible breakpoints; optical fixes applied.\n- Assets are harmonized (radii, borders, shadows, caption positions) with flawless consistency across diverse content.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Consistent grid and spacing; clear section hierarchy; strong alignment.\n- Image/asset handling is deliberate and cohesive; cards/tiles feel unified and intentional.\n- Minor roughness allowed (e.g., one floaty element or a narrow gutter anomaly).\n- Important: Uniform card grids can earn 4 when mats/radii/spacing are notably refined and captions/labels are disciplined. Otherwise default to 3.\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline\n- Basic grid is present and mostly consistent; sections are readable with adequate spacing.\n- Common patterns (single column, centered hero, simple card grid) executed decently but without sophistication or a distinct POV.\n- Some inconsistencies in gutters, container widths, or vertical rhythm.\n\nScore 1\u20132: Weak/Poor\n- Random placement; competing focal points; inconsistent container widths with no rationale.\n- Haphazard screenshot handling; generic device mocks dominate; mixed radii/shadows; misaligned captions.\n- Cramped or wasteful spacing obscuring hierarchy.\n\nCommon deductions:\n- Evidence limited to a single hero or short view: cap at 3 unless Minimalism Exception Check passes.\n- \u201cClean but generic\u201d: centered hero + simple grid with soft shadows/rounded corners and no clear POV\u2014do not exceed 3 without visible refinement (precise rhythm, tuned mats, optical alignment).\n\n## Color (Weight: 30%)\n\nWhat to examine:\n- Palette quality: harmony, hue/value control, and consistency across sections.\n- Neutrals: are greys/blacks tuned; borders and shadows hue-shifted; overlays subtle?\n- Accent strategy: scarcity and consistency; link/CTA states; role clarity.\n- Integration with imagery: does the shell unify diverse screenshots/tiles? Are mats/backgrounds harmonized?\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Sophisticated palette with precise value control; accents are sparse yet highly effective.\n- Neutrals and shadows are tuned; borders/overlays have intentional tints; color choices unify varied content effortlessly.\n- Color expresses identity without noise, consistently across sections.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Harmonious palette with controlled accents; link/CTA system clearly defined (hover/active visible or inferred from consistency).\n- Neutrals intentionally tuned (not pure black/white) supporting readability.\n- Minor issues only (e.g., one accent slightly loud or a single mismatched gradient).\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline\n- Serviceable palette; minimal shell with a single accent or defaultish link blue used acceptably.\n- When colorful work tiles provide most color, the chrome does not clash; lacks active unification (e.g., inconsistent mats/shadows) that would lift it to 4.\n\nScore 1\u20132: Weak/Poor\n- Too many hues without a throughline; inconsistent values; clashing gradients.\n- Flat untuned greys; heavy default-dark shadows; inaccessible text contrast.\n\nCommon deductions:\n- Relying on work screenshots for color while the shell is neutral does not merit 4\u20135 by itself; look for unifying tactics (matched tile backgrounds, tuned borders/shadows, balanced sequencing).\n- Default link blue that feels loud against soft greys; inconsistent hover/visited states within the visible view.\n\nHow to spot tuned vs default color in minimal pages:\n- Tuned: blue slightly desaturated or hue-shifted, consistent underline thickness/offset, hover/visited state visible or plausibly consistent; neutrals off-black/off-white; dividers very light and even.\n- Default: pure #000/#fff, harsh 0,0,255-like blue, generic shadows, inconsistent border tints.\n\n## Red Flags\n\nFlag these when clearly present and reflect them in explanations.\n\n- template_scent_high:\n  - Obvious boilerplate patterns with minimal customization: centered hero with generic subhead + uniform card grid; stock \u201cAbout\u201d block; boilerplate footer; default link styles.\n  - Tokens that mirror popular UI kits without page-level decisions: identical 16px radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues; identical card shadows.\n  - Repeated canned sections with identical structure and no bespoke visual decisions.\n\n- sloppy_images:\n  - Inconsistent crops/aspect ratios; mixed or mismatched corner radii; aliasing/jaggies; compression artifacts; non-retina blurriness.\n  - Generic device frames without customization; screenshots too zoomed out or illegible; inconsistent mats/shadows around tiles.\n  - Misaligned captions/labels; mixed border weights; inconsistent drop shadow directions.\n\n- process_soup:\n  - Long process timelines/diagrams overwhelming final visuals; walls of sticky-note photos overshadowing product.\n  - Persona/journey maps with unreadable small text; few outcome visuals.\n\nNote: Only add red flags when visual evidence is clear. If uncertain, omit the flag and reduce confidence instead.\n\n---\n\n# EXEMPLAR CALIBRATION\n\nUse these exemplar evaluations to calibrate your scoring. Prioritize the rubric; exemplars are anchors, not instructions. Use the full 1\u20135 range when warranted. Note especially how minimal pages can score 4\u20135 when micro\u2011craft is evident.\n\n## Exemplar 1 (Score: 4.0)\nPortfolio Category: Minimal  \nSite URL: https://charliedeets.com/  \nImage: exemplar_1.jpg\n\nTypography (Score: 4): Minimal system sans with strong contrast and restrained hierarchy.
