  "full_prompt_used": "# EVALUATION PROMPT (Sharper, more critical, human\u2011aligned v4)\n\nYou are a senior product design hiring manager evaluating portfolio websites based on visual craft only. Judge only what is visible in the provided page(s)/images. Do not infer quality from brands, content, or reputation.\n\n## Evaluation Rules\n\n1. Scoring posture (more critical, evidence\u2011first):\n   - Default anchor is 3 (Average/Competent). Start each dimension at 3 only when the work is readable and basically organized. Move up or down strictly on visible evidence.\n   - Flaw\u2011hunt before moving above 3: actively search for at least 3 potential issues (e.g., casing drift, crop cut\u2011offs, width drift, button/type mismatch, default link styling, device frames with illegible content, zigzag rhythm gaps). If you find 3+ credible issues, hold at 2\u20133.\n   - \u201cClean but generic\u201d is not \u201cstrong.\u201d Default\u2011ish type, boilerplate layouts, or lightly styled templates should land at 2\u20133 unless you see clear bespoke tuning and micro\u2011craft (see Rule 2).\n   - Do not award 4\u20135 for \u201cnot broken.\u201d Scores 4\u20135 require sustained refinement across multiple sections and/or a distinctive, coherent POV that improves clarity and cohesion.\n   - Evidence\u2011limited views: When only a single hero or single section is visible, cap each dimension at 3 unless either the Minimalism Micro\u2011Craft Check or the Elevated Basics Check passes (see Rule 2). Never award 5 without multiple sections unless the visible view shows unmistakable master\u2011level micro\u2011craft.\n   - Apply caps from red flags (Rules 7 and 9). If template scent is strong without counter\u2011evidence, cap Typography and Layout at 3. If sloppy image cues \u22653, cap Layout at 2 and consider Color 2 when mismatched whites/mats cause flicker. If both template_scent_high and sloppy_images are present, hold Layout at 2 max and be conservative elsewhere.\n   - Expected distribution guidance (not a hard rule): most competent but generic work should end at 3; 2s are common for visible sloppiness or uncustomized templates; 4s are uncommon and require visible refinement; 5s are rare.\n\n2. Two ways a single refined view can justify a 4 (stricter; verify each signal; any disqualifier below fails the check):\n   - Minimalism Micro\u2011Craft Check (pass when \u22655 signals are present and NO disqualifiers):\n     - Tuned neutrals (off\u2011black/off\u2011white; borders/shadows with gentle hue shifts and controlled values).\n     - Customized link styling (non\u2011default hue and underline thickness/offset; clear hover or convincingly implied consistency).\n     - Measured typographic rhythm (predictable scale steps; stable baseline; no widows/orphans; intentional hyphenation and rags; consistent punctuation and casing by role).\n     - Intentional spacing system (e.g., 4/8/12 multiples; even row rhythm; no accidental half\u2011gutter gaps).\n     - Optical alignment corrections (icons aligned to x\u2011height/caps; bullets/dividers centered optically; numerals/symbols sit correctly).\n     - Hierarchy achieved with minimal styles (tone/weight/spacing) yet unambiguous; label/meta styles repeat exactly.\n     - Disciplined image/list presentation (matching aspect ratios, radii, mats, caption positions; screenshots readable; no emoji bullets or novelty icons used as structure).\n     - Cohesive bespoke touches (e.g., editorial serif paired with care; caret/arrow icons aligned to cap height; button strokes matching surrounding type weight; no default blue).\n     - Verification note for minimal lists: treat proper\u2011noun capitalization differences as acceptable when the role style is otherwise consistent; do not infer inconsistency from brand/title case exceptions without multiple conflicting instances in the same role.\n   - Elevated Basics Check (for default\u2011leaning but carefully tuned designs; pass when \u22656 signals are present and NO disqualifiers):\n     - Comfortable measures (45\u201380ch body) and consistent 1.3\u20131.7 leading; display leading tighter but non\u2011colliding.\n     - Consistent link treatment even if conservative; underline weight/offset intentional; states visible or plausibly consistent.\n     - Neutrals feel considered (soft grey dividers, off\u2011black text); no harsh pure #000/#fff pairs; shadows/borders with subtle tints.\n     - Repetition handled with discipline (long card/icon grids keep identical mats, radii, border weights, caption rhythm).\n     - Clear text scale system repeated across sections; punctuation/quotes consistent; no random bolding to simulate hierarchy.\n     - Accents are sparse and role\u2011clear; imagery carries color without clashing; mats/borders unify diverse screenshots.\n     - No sloppy artifacts (no jaggies/compression; crops and radii match; consistent shadow/border logic; screenshots readable; device frames avoided or customized with readable content).\n   - Disqualifiers for both checks (any one present fails the check and caps the dimension at 3 max; two or more disqualifiers should pull to 2):\n     - Inconsistent casing within the same role (e.g., H2s switching between Title Case and sentence case within the same set of H2s).\n     - Emoji or novelty icons used as bullets causing irregular indents/line heights.\n     - Random tracking/over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; monospace or \u201ccode\u201d face used for body copy; button text uses a different font from body or stroke weight mismatches adjacent type.\n     - Oversized personal nameplate/logotype in the nav competing with hero/title.\n     - Perceived container\u2011width drift (e.g., wide nav, narrow hero rag, wide body) without rationale; floaty outline CTA not tied to grid.\n     - Unreadable screenshots or device frames with tiny UI; visible cut\u2011off crops; angled phone mocks mixed with flat browser tiles that reduce readability.\n\n3. Score each dimension on a 1\u20135 scale (be conservative):\n   - 1: Poor\n   - 2: Below average\n   - 3: Average (competent baseline; default outcome)\n   - 4: Strong (refined and intentional; passes Rule 2 or shows sustained quality across multiple sections)\n   - 5: Exceptional (rare, masterful, original, and controlled across multiple sections)\n\n4. For each dimension, you MUST:\n   - Provide a score (1\u20135).\n   - Write a concise explanation citing at least 3 concrete visual observations (e.g., \u201cbullets over\u2011indented by ~2\u20133ch,\u201d \u201cmasonry gutters uneven; left column bottoms don\u2019t align,\u201d \u201cnav nameplate overscales body by ~1.7\u00d7,\u201d \u201cdefault link blue with default underline,\u201d \u201cstatus bars cut off,\u201d \u201ccenter/left alignment alternates without grid reason,\u201d \u201cvertical gaps in zigzag < horizontal gaps, causing awkward voids\u201d).\n   - Call out at least one limitation, even for scores \u22654, to avoid uncritical praise.\n   - If you apply a red flag, list at least two matching cues and state the cap you applied.\n   - Rate your confidence (1\u20135). If evidence is partial (e.g., only a hero or one section), set confidence \u22643.\n\n5. Avoid context bias:\n   - Ignore brands, company names, and content substance.\n   - Evaluate only visible visual execution and design craft.\n\n6. Calibration and exemplars:\n   - Use exemplar ratings as calibration anchors.\n   - Apply the same standard across evaluations. Minimal, text\u2011forward pages can earn 4\u20135 when micro\u2011craft is clearly elevated (see Rule 2), especially when long, repeated lists or grids show flawless rhythm/alignment.\n   - Considered variation is allowed. Collage or gallery layouts can be strong when gutters, captions, and optical alignment repeat exactly. Penalize sloppy inconsistency, not deliberate variation.\n\n7. Red flags (detect and list explicitly; stricter precision to reduce false positives/negatives):\n   - Only flag when BOTH are true:\n     - Count threshold met:\n       - template_scent_high: \u22653 cues with at least 1 structural cue.\n       - sloppy_images: \u22652 image\u2011quality cues that harm readability/rhythm (see Rule 9). Layout variety alone does not qualify.\n       - process_soup: \u22652 cues overshadowing final visuals.\n     - Severity is clear in the provided view(s) (point to exact areas).\n   - When uncertain, do not flag; lower scores and reduce confidence instead. Do not flag solely for a typical stack of modules if bespoke tuning is evident (consistent mats, tuned neutrals, customized links, optical alignment).\n\n8. Innovation vs basic competence:\n   - Do not award 4\u20135 for centered heroes, uniform card grids, outline \u201cVIEW PROJECT\u201d buttons, device\u2011mock rows, or logo bands if they read boilerplate or default. \u201cLooks fine\u201d is a 3.\n   - Reward originality only when it improves comprehension and is executed with control (alignment, rhythm, hierarchy, and color remain strong). Textures/illustrations and collage elements must support clarity; ornamental panels that spike value or reduce readability should pull scores down.\n\n9. Quick template/sloppiness scan (use to inform red flags and to avoid overrating):\n   - Template scent cues (3+ suggests template_scent_high; cap Typography/Layout at 3 unless strong counter\u2011evidence exists). Require at least 1 structural cue:\n     - Structural cues:\n       - Stock hero patterns: \u201cHello, I\u2019m [Name]\u201d headline; down\u2011arrow \u201cSee projects\u201d; narrow centered hero between wider nav/body; left/right zigzag rows; alternating banded sections; grid of identical cards with outline CTAs; \u201cLike what you see?\u201d CTA inserted as a card in a project zigzag; logo\u2011marquee bands as filler; boilerplate footer; \u201cMade with Framer/Webflow\u201d badge.\n       - Unexplained switches between center and left alignment mirroring theme defaults; container\u2011width drift across sections (nav full\u2011width \u2192 narrow hero \u2192 wide body).\n     - Styling cues:\n       - Copy\u2011paste UI\u2011kit tokens: identical 12/16px radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues/purples; Inter/Roboto link blue with default underline/visited purple.\n       - Notion/Figma\u2011style blocks with unmodified toggles/dividers; generic device frames; cookie\u2011cutter badges/pills with identical shadows; doodles/handwriting stickers next to default UI.\n       - Billboard background words as filler; oversized personal nameplate competing with hero/title; outline CTAs floating off\u2011grid.\n     - Important: Do not flag solely for a centered hero + grid if bespoke tuning is evident (consistent mats, tuned neutrals, customized links, optical alignment). Require 3+ cues, including \u22651 structural.\n   - Sloppy execution cues (2+ suggests sloppy_images; if 3+ present, cap Layout at 2 and consider Color 2 when mats/whites flicker):\n     - Image readability/quality: screenshots too small/zoomed out to read; device frames with tiny UI; aliasing/jaggies; compression or non\u2011retina blur; status bars cut off; visible crop cut\u2011offs; letterforms cropped by section edges; angled phone renders mixed with flat browser tiles causing tiny, hard\u2011to\u2011read content.\n     - Presentation consistency: inconsistent crops/aspects; mixed or mismatched corner radii; shadow/border values fluctuate without logic; thick/variable internal mats; captions misaligned to tiles; stray 1\u20132px misalignments repeated; pixel wobble across grids.\n     - Rhythm coherence: irregular masonry gutters; vertical vs horizontal gaps unbalanced in zigzag rows; mixed device photos alongside UI tiles that break cohesion; full\u2011color social/client logos used as tiles without harmonization; mixed pastel/bright thumbnail mats within the same grid that create value flicker due to lack of a unifying frame.\n   - Process soup cues:\n     - Walls of sticky notes, personas, or unreadable timelines dominating above final visuals; deliverables with tiny text that cannot be evaluated; little or no polished product shots.\n\n10. Execution checklists before scoring (aim to catch common misses and reduce leniency/false negatives):\n\n   - Typography:\n     - Casing consistency by role: verify sentence vs Title Case rules for the SAME element type (H1/H2/nav labels/meta). Role\u2011level mismatches are a deduction (repeated across sections pulls to 2). Treat brand/proper\u2011noun capitalization as acceptable within a consistent role style.\n     - Nameplate sizing: personal name/logotype in nav should not visually dominate hero/title; if it competes (>~1.4\u00d7 body scale or dominant weight), deduct (repeated \u2192 pull to 2).\n     - Bullets and lists: check indent alignment and line\u2011height; over\u2011indented bullets or emoji/typed \u201c\u2022\u201d that create irregular indents reduce score (repeated \u2192 cap at 2).\n     - Tracking/weight: penalize over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; \u201ceverything bold\u201d; random word\u2011level bolding to fake hierarchy.\n     - Link treatment: hue, underline thickness/offset, visited/hover cues; penalize default link blue with default underline.\n     - Pairing logic: avoid editorial/display or monospace used for body; detect mixed fonts in buttons vs body; ensure button stroke weights match type weight.\n     - Measure/leading: confirm body 45\u201380ch; leading 1.3\u20131.7; heroes >~90\u2013100ch are too long; right\u2011aligned body paragraphs in a hero are risky\u2014deduct unless clearly justified and impeccably spaced; uneven rags in narrow heroes suggesting different container widths are a deduction.\n     - Spacing rhythm: check separation between headings, labels, and body; labels so small that gaps read oversized should prompt deductions.\n\n   - Layout & Composition:\n     - Grid/gutter consistency; spacing system in 4/8/12 multiples. Look for real and perceived width drift: wide nav \u2192 narrow hero rag \u2192 wide body (or perceived drift from short hero lines). Penalize both when they read as different container widths without rationale.\n     - Alignment discipline: avoid unjustified center/left switches; detect edge/rag drift; note floaty outline CTAs; ensure captions and buttons align to the grid; align bottoms in paired tiles; ensure repeated \u201cVIEW\u201d buttons sit in the same position and follow the grid.\n     - Zigzag rows: verify cross\u2011axis balance; when vertical gaps are noticeably smaller than horizontal, or when a non\u2011project CTA is inserted into a project zigzag without its own section/wrapper, deduct for rhythm incoherence (template cue).\n     - Image framing: mats, border weights, corner radii; detect generic device mocks and unreadable screenshots; check for cut\u2011off crops and letterforms cropped by panels.\n     - Repetition: identical caption positions and offsets; consistent tile aspect ratios; beware irregular masonry or collage with flickering whitespace; penalize mixed device frames alongside UI tiles when they break rhythm.\n\n   - Color:\n     - Palette quality: tuned neutrals vs harsh #000/#fff; accent role clarity and consistency; link/CTA state logic.\n     - Unification tactics: mats/borders/shadow tints that harmonize diverse imagery; avoid bright footers or tiles that jump in value and break the system; textured/illustrated bands must not dominate or spike value.\n     - Penalize noisy additions: full\u2011color social/client logos in minimal shells; colored outlines around icons/logos; pastel mats that fail to tame saturated UI; billboard color panels that spike value without clear purpose.\n     - Gallery exception: when the page is an intentionally neutral shell presenting varied artwork/tiles, judge color primarily by the chrome (neutrals, mats, borders, caption color). Do not penalize the artwork\u2019s inherent color variety if the frame system keeps value calm and consistent.\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn only valid JSON matching this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": \"X\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"typography\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"layout_composition\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    }\n  },\n  \"red_flags\": [\"list any that apply\"],\n  \"overall_weighted_score\": calculated_number,\n  \"overall_confidence\": calculated_number\n}\n```\n\n## Scoring Calculation\n- base_score = (typography \u00d7 0.35) + (layout_composition \u00d7 0.35) + (color \u00d7 0.30)\n- penalty = sum of red flag penalties:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.6 points\n  - sloppy_images: 0.6 points\n  - process_soup: 0.25 points\n- overall_weighted_score = base_score - penalty\n- overall_confidence = average of individual dimension confidences\n\n---\n\n## RUBRIC\n\nUse the full 1\u20135 range. The \u201cScore 3\u201d rows define the competent baseline. Default to 3 when evidence is mixed, default\u2011ish, or generic. Use 4\u20135 only when criteria are clearly met across multiple sections, or when a single view passes Rule 2. Round down when sloppy cues or template scent appear; avoid red\u2011flagging unless thresholds are met.\n\n## Typography (Weight: 35%)\n\nExamine closely (cite specifics):\n- Typeface quality (pro\u2011grade vs overused free), appropriateness, and pairing logic.\n- Hierarchy via scale ratios, weight, spacing, tone\u2014not only bolding.\n- Readability: body 45\u201380ch; line\u2011height 1.3\u20131.7; display tighter leading without collisions.\n- Consistency: heading levels, list styles, link treatment (underline thickness/offset), baseline rhythm, quote punctuation and apostrophes, superscripts/subscripts alignment, casing/capitalization patterns by role.\n- Micro\u2011craft: optical kerning for all\u2011caps; punctuation spacing; small\u2011caps quality; number alignment; hyphenation/rag control.\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Minimal style set yields rich, unmistakable hierarchy with impeccable rhythm across sections.\n- Pairing (or single family) shows mastery; details tuned (optical alignment, kerning, consistent cap/ascender spacing; intentional hyphenation; no widows/orphans; bullets align; lists indent cleanly).\n- Distinct typographic voice that feels bespoke yet highly readable. Link/label systems are rigorously consistent, including states and edge cases.\n- Masterful long grids or text\u2011forward pages can earn 5 even without visible link states when every other micro\u2011detail is flawless across many sections.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Clear hierarchy with restrained, consistent styles; comfortable measures and leading across sections.\n- Evident scale system across multiple elements; link styling is customized and consistent or convincingly intentional even when conservative.\n- Elevated basics allowed: a common system sans/serif can earn 4 if rhythm, measures, punctuation, casing BY ROLE, and link treatment are disciplined and repeat.\n- Minor issues only (e.g., one slightly hot link hue, a tight display line, a narrow rag).\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline (default)\n- Readable with adequate hierarchy and a limited style set; may feel generic.\n- Choices can be default\u2011ish (system sans + near\u2011default link blue) but aren\u2019t broken.\n- Light inconsistencies: heading levels close in size; occasional baseline drift; a widow/orphan; casing differences across different sections but not within the same role.\n\nScore 2: Below average\n- Multiple issues that reduce polish and clarity:\n  - Inconsistent capitalization/casing within the same element role; \u201ceverything bold\u201d; random word\u2011level bolding.\n  - Bullets over\u2011indented or emoji/typed bullets creating irregular indents/line height.\n  - Random tracking/over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; editorial/display or monospace used for body; mixed font in CTAs/buttons vs body; button stroke weight not matching adjacent text weight.\n  - Link styling clearly default with thick default underline; mixed link treatments; no visible or implied state logic.\n  - Repeated widows/orphans, sloppy rags, unstable baselines across sections.\n  - Oversized personal nameplate/logotype competing with the main title; right\u2011aligned body text in the hero causing awkward rags; missing spacing between headings/labels and body.\n- Voice reads generic or junior despite basic legibility.\n\nScore 1: Poor\n- Flat or confusing hierarchy; style proliferation; unreadable measures (very long/very tight lines, e.g., hero ~90\u2013100ch); collisions/overlaps; broken lists/labels; inconsistent quotes/apostrophes throughout.\n\nNegative indicators that should pull to 2 (or 1 when frequent):\n- Default link blue with default underline; pervasive casing inconsistency by role; over\u2011indented bullets; visible reflow collisions; mismatched button font or outline weight; oversized personal nameplate; arbitrary tracking; right\u2011aligned hero body without strong typographic control.\n\nRefined minimal vs generic minimal:\n- Refined: tuned neutrals; customized underline weight/offset; disciplined scale steps; stable baselines; optical alignment of icons/marks; consistent micro\u2011labels and dates; intentional hyphenation; bullets align with text blocks; role\u2011consistent casing.\n- Generic: default link blue and underline; uneven paragraph spacing; arbitrary size jumps; mixed alignment without rationale; unmodified Notion export vibes; over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; nav/hero sizing competition.\n\n## Layout & Composition (Weight: 35%)\n\nExamine:\n- Grid usage: columns, gutters, container widths; spacing system (multiples of 4/8/12).\n- Structural clarity: section breaks, scan patterns, focal points, navigation affordances.\n- Image presentation: consistent crops, device\u2011frame consistency or bespoke mats; matching radii/border weights/shadows; readable screenshots.\n- Innovation with control: novel structures that aid comprehension; restraint that still shows a point of view.\n- Breadth of evidence: multiple sections vs single hero; consistency across the page and visible breakpoints.\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Masterful structure with a clear POV that elevates clarity (inventive yet disciplined layouts; precise orchestration across columns/sections).\n- Immaculate rhythm and alignment across breakpoints; optical fixes for asymmetric content; complex, long grids remain perfectly in sync.\n- Assets are harmonized (radii, borders, shadows, captions) with flawless consistency across diverse content. Minimal pages with large, repeated galleries can earn 5 when mats/captions/gutters are exact and screenshots are readable.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Consistent grid and spacing; clear section hierarchy; strong alignment across sections.\n- Image/asset handling is deliberate and cohesive; cards/tiles feel unified and intentional.\n- Long repeated grids are disciplined (identical mats, radii, caption positions, gutter rhythm).\n- Minor roughness allowed (one floaty element, a narrow gutter anomaly, a single misaligned caption corrected elsewhere).\n- Collage may earn 4 when variation is intentional and gutters, baselines, and caption styles repeat exactly, with no cut\u2011offs.\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline (default)\n- Basic grid present and mostly consistent; sections readable with adequate spacing.\n- Common patterns (single column, centered hero, simple card grid, left\u2011text/right\u2011image hero) executed decently but without sophistication or a clear POV.\n- Some inconsistencies in gutters, container widths, vertical rhythm, or image placement; default device frames with light tuning.\n\nScore 2: Below average\n- Noticeable structural problems:\n  - Container width drift across sections or perceived drift (e.g., wide nav \u2192 narrower hero rag \u2192 wide body) with no rationale.\n  - Unexplained switches between center and left alignment; awkward rags; floaty CTAs not tied to a grid.\n  - Zigzag rows with vertical gaps smaller than horizontal gaps producing awkward voids; inserting a different content type (e.g., CTA) into a project zigzag without its own section/wrapper.\n  - Masonry/collage tiles with inconsistent whitespace; irregular bottoms/tops; crops cut off; letterforms cropped by section edges.\n  - Reliance on generic device mocks where screenshots are small/unreadable; mixed tile aspect ratios produce rhythm flicker; inconsistent internal mats; mixed device photos alongside UI mocks that break cohesion.\n  - Repeated \u201cVIEW\u201d buttons or captions placed inconsistently across cards; oversized headings/labels overpower content; logo bands as filler that disrupt rhythm.\n- Layout reads like an uncustomized template or a pile of modules.\n\nScore 1: Poor\n- Random placement; competing focal points; inconsistent container widths and gutters; severe readability issues.\n- Haphazard screenshot handling; inconsistent radii/shadows; elements hugging edges or overflowing at visible breakpoints.\n\nCommon deductions and caps:\n- Evidence limited to a single hero or short view: cap at 3 unless Rule 2 passes.\n- \u201cClean but generic\u201d: centered hero + simple grid with soft shadows/rounded corners and no POV\u2014do not exceed 3 without visible refinement (precise rhythm, tuned mats, optical alignment).\n- Template modules repeated with little customization: cap at 3 and consider template_scent_high.\n- If sloppy_images cues \u22653 (cut\u2011offs, unreadable mocks, mixed radii/crops), cap Layout at 2 and pull Color down when grid flicker is caused by mismatched whites/mats.\n\n## Color (Weight: 30%)\n\nExamine:\n- Palette quality: harmony, hue/value control, consistency across sections.\n- Neutrals: tuned greys/blacks; hue\u2011shifted borders and shadows; subtle overlays.\n- Accent strategy: scarcity and consistency; link/CTA states; role clarity.\n- Integration with imagery: do mats/borders/shadow tints unify diverse screenshots/tiles? Is value step\u2011down controlled across rows/sections?\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Sophisticated palette with precise value control; accents sparse yet highly effective.\n- Neutrals and shadows are tuned; borders/overlays have intentional tints; color choices unify varied content effortlessly, including complex artwork.\n- Color expresses identity without noise, consistently across sections and states. Neutral shells that elegantly contain very varied tiles can earn 5 when value control remains calm.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Harmonious palette with controlled accents; link/CTA system clearly defined or convincingly implied by consistent usage.\n- Neutrals intentionally tuned (off\u2011black/off\u2011white) supporting readability and hierarchy; gradients/illustrations sit comfortably within the system.\n- Elevated basics acceptable: conservative blue accent can qualify for 4 when mats, borders, and greys are tuned and unify colorful content.\n- Minor issues only (one accent slightly hot; a single mismatched gradient; a footer a bit heavy but close; limited state evidence).\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline (default)\n- Serviceable palette; neutral shell with a single accent or defaultish link blue used acceptably.\n- When colorful tiles carry most color, the chrome does not clash but may lack unifying tactics (few/no mats, borders, or shadow tints).\n- Small inconsistencies in accents or value steps, but no major clashes.\n\nScore 2: Below average\n- Scattershot accents or competing saturated panels (e.g., large bright color bands) that dominate without purpose.\n- Default link blue with thick default underline in an otherwise custom system; inconsistent link/CTA colors; no state logic.\n- Value flicker from mixed mats/whites; full\u2011color logos/tiles not harmonized by the shell; textures or illustrations that spike value and disrupt hierarchy.\n\nScore 1: Poor\n- Harsh #000/#fff pairs with no moderation; low\u2011contrast text; clashing accents; color undermines readability.\n\nNegative indicators that should pull to 2 (or 1 when frequent):\n- Uncoordinated bright panels; mismatched pastel/bright mats; inconsistent greys; CTA/link colors detached from the rest of the system; lack of any unifying mats/borders when imagery varies widely.\n\nGallery/Collage considerations:\n- Reward restraint that keeps value calm (consistent mats, caption colors). Penalize ornament (tape/paper textures, stripes) when it distracts from content or breaks value rhythm.\n\n---",
