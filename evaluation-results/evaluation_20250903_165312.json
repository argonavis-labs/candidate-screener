  "full_prompt_used": "# EVALUATION PROMPT\n\nYou are a senior product design hiring manager evaluating portfolio websites based on visual craft only. Judge only what is visible in the provided page(s)/images. Do not infer quality from brands, content, or reputation.\n\n## Evaluation Rules\n\n1. Scoring posture (critical, calibrated, and specific):\n   - Use the full 1\u20135 range. A 3 (Average/Competent) is the default for solid but unremarkable work.\n   - Scores 4\u20135 require visible refinement and/or a distinctive, coherent point of view\u2014beyond \u201cnot broken.\u201d\n   - Evidence-limited views: When only a single hero or single section is visible, cap each dimension at 3 unless either the Minimalism Micro\u2011Craft Check or the Elevated Basics Check passes (see Rule 2). Only award 5 with multiple sections, or if the visible section shows unmistakable, master-level micro\u2011craft.\n\n2. Two ways a single refined view can justify a 4:\n   - Minimalism Micro\u2011Craft Check (pass when \u22654 signals are present):\n     - Tuned neutrals (off\u2011black/off\u2011white; borders/shadows hue\u2011shifted and value\u2011controlled).\n     - Customized link styling (non\u2011default hue/underline thickness/offset; clear hover or convincingly consistent implied state).\n     - Measured typographic rhythm (consistent ratio steps, stable baseline, no widows/orphans).\n     - Intentional spacing system (e.g., 8/12/16 multiples; even row rhythm).\n     - Optical alignment corrections (icons on baseline/caps; bullets/dividers centered optically).\n     - Hierarchy achieved with minimal styles (tone/weight/spacing) yet unambiguous.\n     - Disciplined image/list presentation (matching aspect ratios, radii, mats, caption positions).\n     - Page\u2011level voice is distinctive despite restraint (e.g., editorial serif applied with control; subtle bespoke detail).\n   - Elevated Basics Check (for \u201cdefault\u2011leaning but tuned\u201d designs; pass when \u22655 signals are present):\n     - Comfortable measures (45\u201380ch body) and consistent 1.3\u20131.7 leading; display leading tighter but non\u2011colliding.\n     - Consistent link treatment even if the blue is close to default; underline weight/offset looks intentional; states are visible or plausibly consistent.\n     - Neutrals feel considered (soft grey dividers, off\u2011black text); no harsh pure #000/#fff pairs.\n     - Repetition handled with discipline (e.g., long card/icon grids keep identical mats, radii, border weights, caption rhythm).\n     - Clear scale system across text (e.g., predictable size/weight steps); labels/metadata styles repeat exactly.\n     - Accents are sparse and role\u2011clear; imagery does the color lifting but the shell never clashes.\n     - No sloppy artifacts (no jaggies/compression; crops and radii match; consistent shadow/border logic).\n\n3. Score each dimension on a 1\u20135 scale:\n   - 1: Poor\n   - 2: Below average\n   - 3: Average (competent baseline)\n   - 4: Strong (refined and intentional)\n   - 5: Exceptional (rare, masterful, and original)\n\n4. For each dimension, you MUST:\n   - Provide a score (1\u20135).\n   - Write a concise explanation citing at least 3 concrete visual observations (e.g., \u201ceven 56\u201364ch measure,\u201d \u201cunderline offset aligns to x\u2011height,\u201d \u201ctile radii unified at 12px; borders 1px with subtle hue shift\u201d).\n   - Call out at least one limitation, even for scores \u22654, to avoid uncritical praise.\n   - Rate your confidence (1\u20135). If evidence is partial (e.g., only a hero or one section), set confidence \u22643.\n\n5. Avoid context bias:\n   - Ignore brands, company names, and content substance.\n   - Evaluate only visible visual execution and design craft.\n\n6. Be consistent with exemplars:\n   - Use exemplar ratings as calibration anchors.\n   - Apply the same standard across evaluations. Minimal, text\u2011forward pages can earn 4 when micro\u2011craft is clearly elevated (see Rule 2).\n\n7. Check for red flags and list them when present:\n   - template_scent_high\n   - sloppy_images\n   - process_soup\n\n8. Innovation vs. basic competence:\n   - Do not award 4\u20135 for merely clean centered layouts or uniform grids if they feel boilerplate.\n   - Reward originality only when it improves clarity and is executed with control.\n   - Also reward \u201celevated basics\u201d: conservative, default\u2011leaning styling that is measurably tuned, consistent, and disciplined across many repeated elements.\n\n9. Quick template sniff\u2011test (use to inform red flags and to avoid overrating):\n   - Look for copy\u2011paste tokens from common UI kits without page\u2011level decisions: identical 12/16px corner radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues/purples; Inter/Roboto with default link blue and default underline; hero \u201cHi, I\u2019m \u2026\u201d + centered subhead + grid of identical cards; generic sticky footer; mismatched dark footer; default visited purple. If 3+ of these appear with minimal customization, lean toward template_scent_high and cap dimension scores at 3 unless strong counter\u2011evidence exists.\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn only valid JSON matching this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": \"X\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"typography\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"layout_composition\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    }\n  },\n  \"red_flags\": [\"list any that apply\"],\n  \"overall_weighted_score\": calculated_number,\n  \"overall_confidence\": calculated_number\n}\n```\n\n## Scoring Calculation\n- base_score = (typography \u00d7 0.35) + (layout_composition \u00d7 0.35) + (color \u00d7 0.30)\n- penalty = sum of red flag penalties:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.5 points\n  - sloppy_images: 0.3 points\n  - process_soup: 0.2 points\n- overall_weighted_score = base_score - penalty\n- overall_confidence = average of individual dimension confidences\n\n---\n\n# RUBRIC\n\nFollow this rubric strictly. The \u201cScore 3\u201d rows define the competent baseline. Use 4\u20135 only when criteria are clearly met across multiple sections, or when a single view passes Rule 2.\n\n## Typography (Weight: 35%)\n\nWhat to examine (look closely and cite specifics):\n- Typeface quality (pro\u2011grade vs overused free), appropriateness, and pairing logic.\n- Hierarchy via scale ratios, weight, spacing, and tone\u2014not only bolding.\n- Readability: body 45\u201380ch; line\u2011height 1.3\u20131.7; display sizes tighter leading without collisions.\n- Consistency: heading levels, list styles, link treatment (underline thickness/offset), baseline rhythm, quote punctuation and apostrophes, superscripts/subscripts alignment.\n- Micro\u2011craft: optical kerning for all\u2011caps; punctuation spacing; small\u2011caps quality; date/label alignment.\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- A minimal style set produces rich, unmistakable hierarchy with impeccable rhythm across sections.\n- Pairing (or single family) shows mastery; details tuned (optical alignment, kerning, consistent cap/ascender spacing, hyphenation rules).\n- Distinctive typographic voice that feels bespoke yet highly readable. No widows/orphans; link/label systems are rigorously consistent under variety.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Clear hierarchy with restrained, consistent style usage; comfortable measures and leading.\n- Evident scale system (e.g., modular ratios) across multiple elements; link styling is customized and consistent or convincingly intentional even when conservative.\n- May be \u201celevated basics\u201d: default\u2011leaning blue and common system sans/serif are acceptable if rhythm, measures, and link treatment are disciplined and repeated across the page.\n- Minor issues only (e.g., slightly hot link hue, a single tight display line, a sparse heading level).\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline\n- Readable with acceptable hierarchy and a limited style set.\n- Choices can feel generic (system sans + near\u2011default link blue) but not broken.\n- Noticeable but non\u2011fatal inconsistencies: heading levels close together, uneven bullet spacing, occasional baseline drift, single all\u2011italic paragraph used as hero without obvious tuning.\n\nScore 1\u20132: Below average / Poor\n- Style proliferation (too many sizes/weights) or flat hierarchy; random alignment of labels/dates.\n- Problematic measures (very long lines with airy leading, or cramped body); glaring widows/orphans; sloppy punctuation/superscripts.\n- Low\u2011quality or clashing fonts; mismatched display/body pairing; default underlines with uneven offset and mixed link styles in the same view.\n\nNegative indicators that should pull to 2:\n- Default link blue with thick default underline and no tuning; mixed serif/sans without logic; visible reflow collisions; inconsistent quotation marks/apostrophes.\n\nHow to distinguish generic vs refined minimal type:\n- Refined: tuned neutrals; customized underline weight/offset; disciplined scale steps; stable baselines; optical alignment of icons/marks; consistent micro\u2011labels and dates.\n- Generic: default link blue and underline, uneven paragraph spacing, arbitrary size jumps, mixed alignment without rationale.\n\n## Layout & Composition (Weight: 35%)\n\nWhat to examine:\n- Grid usage: columns, gutters, container widths; spacing system (multiples of 4/8/12).\n- Structural clarity: section breaks, scan patterns, focal points, navigation affordances.\n- Image presentation: consistent crops, device\u2011frame consistency or bespoke mats, matching radii/border weights/shadows.\n- Innovation with control: novel structures that aid comprehension; restraint that still shows a point of view.\n- Breadth of evidence: multiple sections vs single hero; consistency across the page.\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Masterful structure with a clear POV that elevates clarity (inventive yet disciplined layouts, precise orchestration across columns/sections).\n- Immaculate rhythm and alignment at visible breakpoints; optical fixes applied.\n- Assets are harmonized (radii, borders, shadows, captions) with flawless consistency across diverse content.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Consistent grid and spacing; clear section hierarchy; strong alignment.\n- Image/asset handling is deliberate and cohesive; cards/tiles feel unified and intentional.\n- Long repeated grids are kept disciplined (identical mats, radii, caption positions, gutter rhythm).\n- Minor roughness allowed (one floaty element or a narrow gutter anomaly).\n- Important: Uniform card grids can earn 4 when mats/radii/spacing are notably refined and captions/labels are disciplined. Otherwise default to 3.\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline\n- Basic grid present and mostly consistent; sections are readable with adequate spacing.\n- Common patterns (single column, centered hero, simple card grid) executed decently but without sophistication or a clear POV.\n- Some inconsistencies in gutters, container widths, or vertical rhythm.\n\nScore 1\u20132: Below average / Poor\n- Random placement; competing focal points; inconsistent container widths with no rationale.\n- Haphazard screenshot handling; generic device mocks dominate; mixed radii/shadows; misaligned captions.\n- Cramped or wasteful spacing obscuring hierarchy.\n\nCommon deductions:\n- Evidence limited to a single hero or short view: cap at 3 unless Rule 2 passes.\n- \u201cClean but generic\u201d: centered hero + simple grid with soft shadows/rounded corners and no POV\u2014do not exceed 3 without visible refinement (precise rhythm, tuned mats, optical alignment).\n\n## Color (Weight: 30%)\n\nWhat to examine:\n- Palette quality: harmony, hue/value control, and consistency across sections.\n- Neutrals: tuned greys/blacks; hue\u2011shifted borders and shadows; subtle overlays.\n- Accent strategy: scarcity and consistency; link/CTA states; role clarity.\n- Integration with imagery: does the shell unify diverse screenshots/tiles (mats, border tints, shadow logic, sequencing)?\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Sophisticated palette with precise value control; accents sparse yet highly effective.\n- Neutrals and shadows are tuned; borders/overlays have intentional tints; color choices unify varied content effortlessly.\n- Color expresses identity without noise, consistently across sections and states.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Harmonious palette with controlled accents; link/CTA system clearly defined or convincingly implied by consistent usage.\n- Neutrals intentionally tuned (off\u2011black/off\u2011white) supporting readability and hierarchy.\n- \u201cElevated basics\u201d acceptable: conservative blue accent can qualify for 4 when mats, borders, and greys are tuned and unify colorful content.\n- Minor issues only (one accent slightly hot, single mismatched gradient, or limited state evidence).\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline\n- Serviceable palette; minimal shell with a single accent or defaultish link blue used acceptably.\n- When colorful tiles carry most color, the chrome does not clash but lacks unifying tactics (e.g., inconsistent mats/shadows/border tints) that would lift it to 4.\n\nScore 1\u20132: Below average / Poor\n- Too many hues without a throughline; inconsistent values; clashing gradients.\n- Flat untuned greys; heavy default\u2011dark shadows; inaccessible text contrast; state colors inconsistent.\n\nNegative indicators that should pull to 2:\n- Pure #000/#fff with harsh 0,0,255\u2011like blue; mismatched tile backgrounds; muddy overlays; random hover colors.\n\nHow to spot tuned vs default color in minimal pages:\n- Tuned: slightly desaturated or hue\u2011shifted blue; consistent underline thickness/offset; hover/visited handled or implied by a consistent pattern; off\u2011black/off\u2011white neutrals; very light, even dividers; unified mats/shadows around images.\n- Default: pure black/white; harsh default blues; generic shadows; inconsistent border tints; tiles with different corner radii or shadow directions.\n\n## Red Flags\n\nFlag these when clearly present and reflect them in explanations.\n\n- template_scent_high:\n  - Obvious boilerplate patterns with minimal customization: centered hero with generic subhead + uniform card grid; stock \u201cAbout\u201d block; boilerplate footer; default link styles and underlines.\n  - Tokens that mirror popular UI kits without page\u2011level decisions: identical 12/16px radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues; identical card shadows; Inter/Roboto with untouched link defaults.\n  - Repeated canned sections with identical structure and no bespoke visual decisions or tuning.\n\n- sloppy_images:\n  - Inconsistent crops/aspect ratios; mixed/mismatched corner radii; aliasing/jaggies; compression artifacts; non\u2011retina blurriness.\n  - Generic device frames without customization; screenshots too zoomed out or illegible; inconsistent mats/shadows/border weights around tiles.\n  - Misaligned captions/labels; inconsistent drop\u2011shadow directions; mismatched white balances for tile backgrounds.\n\n- process_soup:\n  - Long timelines/diagrams overwhelming final visuals; walls of sticky\u2011note photos overshadowing product.\n  - Persona/journey maps with unreadable small text; very little outcome imagery.\n\nNote: Only add red flags when visual evidence is clear. If uncertain, omit the flag and reduce confidence instead.\n\n---\n\n# EXEMPLAR CALIBRATION\n\nUse these exemplar evaluations to calibrate your scoring.
