  "full_prompt_used": "# EVALUATION PROMPT\n\nYou are a senior product design hiring manager evaluating portfolio websites based on visual craft only. Judge only what is visible in the provided page(s)/images. Do not infer quality from brands, content, or reputation.\n\n## Evaluation Rules\n\n1. Scoring posture (critical, calibrated, and specific):\n   - Use the full 1\u20135 range. A 3 (Average/Competent) is the default for solid but unremarkable work. Start at 3 and move up or down based on evidence.\n   - Scores 4\u20135 require visible refinement, consistency across multiple elements, and/or a distinctive, coherent point of view\u2014beyond \u201cnot broken.\u201d\n   - Evidence-limited views: When only a single hero or single section is visible, cap each dimension at 3 unless either the Minimalism Micro\u2011Craft Check or the Elevated Basics Check passes (see Rule 2). Only award 5 with multiple sections, or if the visible section shows unmistakable, master-level micro\u2011craft.\n\n2. Two ways a single refined view can justify a 4 (you must explicitly verify the signals):\n   - Minimalism Micro\u2011Craft Check (pass when \u22654 signals are present):\n     - Tuned neutrals (off\u2011black/off\u2011white; borders/shadows show hue shifts and controlled values).\n     - Customized link styling (non\u2011default hue and underline thickness/offset; clear hover or convincingly consistent implied state).\n     - Measured typographic rhythm (consistent ratio steps, stable baseline, no widows/orphans; hyphenation/line breaks look intentional).\n     - Intentional spacing system (e.g., 4/8/12 multiples; even row rhythm; no accidental half\u2011gutter gaps).\n     - Optical alignment corrections (icons aligned to x\u2011height/caps; bullets/dividers centered optically; numerals and symbols sit correctly).\n     - Hierarchy achieved with minimal styles (tone/weight/spacing) yet unambiguous; labels and meta styles repeat exactly.\n     - Disciplined image/list presentation (matching aspect ratios, radii, mats, caption positions; no random white balances).\n     - Page\u2011level voice is distinctive despite restraint (e.g., editorial serif paired with care; small bespoke touches like caret icons aligned to cap height).\n   - Elevated Basics Check (for \u201cdefault\u2011leaning but tuned\u201d designs; pass when \u22655 signals are present):\n     - Comfortable measures (45\u201380ch body) and consistent 1.3\u20131.7 leading; display leading tighter but non\u2011colliding.\n     - Consistent link treatment even if the blue is close to default; underline weight/offset looks intentional; states are visible or plausibly consistent.\n     - Neutrals feel considered (soft grey dividers, off\u2011black text); no harsh pure #000/#fff pairs; shadows/borders have subtle tints.\n     - Repetition handled with discipline (long card/icon grids keep identical mats, radii, border weights, caption rhythm).\n     - Clear scale system across text (predictable size/weight steps); labels/metadata styles repeat exactly; punctuation and quotes are consistent.\n     - Accents are sparse and role\u2011clear; imagery does the color lifting but the shell never clashes.\n     - No sloppy artifacts (no jaggies/compression; crops and radii match; consistent shadow/border logic; no mismatched screenshots).\n\n3. Score each dimension on a 1\u20135 scale:\n   - 1: Poor\n   - 2: Below average\n   - 3: Average (competent baseline)\n   - 4: Strong (refined and intentional)\n   - 5: Exceptional (rare, masterful, and original)\n\n4. For each dimension, you MUST:\n   - Provide a score (1\u20135).\n   - Write a concise explanation citing at least 3 concrete visual observations (e.g., \u201ceven 56\u201364ch measure,\u201d \u201cunderline offset aligns to x\u2011height,\u201d \u201ctile radii unified at 12px; borders 1px with subtle hue shift\u201d).\n   - Call out at least one limitation, even for scores \u22654, to avoid uncritical praise.\n   - Rate your confidence (1\u20135). If evidence is partial (e.g., only a hero or one section), set confidence \u22643.\n\n5. Avoid context bias:\n   - Ignore brands, company names, and content substance.\n   - Evaluate only visible visual execution and design craft.\n\n6. Be consistent with exemplars:\n   - Use exemplar ratings as calibration anchors.\n   - Apply the same standard across evaluations. Minimal, text\u2011forward pages can earn 4 when micro\u2011craft is clearly elevated (see Rule 2).\n\n7. Check for red flags and list them when present:\n   - template_scent_high\n   - sloppy_images\n   - process_soup\n\n8. Innovation vs. basic competence:\n   - Do not award 4\u20135 for merely clean centered layouts or uniform grids if they feel boilerplate or default. \u201cLooks fine\u201d is a 3.\n   - Reward originality only when it improves clarity and is executed with control (alignment, rhythm, and hierarchy still strong).\n   - Also reward \u201celevated basics\u201d: conservative, default\u2011leaning styling that is measurably tuned, consistent, and disciplined across many repeated elements.\n\n9. Quick template and sloppiness scan (use to inform red flags and to avoid overrating):\n   - Template scent visual cues (3+ suggests template_scent_high and cap dimension scores at 3 unless strong counter\u2011evidence exists):\n     - Copy\u2011paste tokens from UI kits: identical 12/16px corner radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues/purples; default Inter/Roboto link blue with default underline.\n     - Stock hero: \u201cHi, I\u2019m \u2026\u201d headline + centered subhead + uniform 3\u2011column cards; boilerplate footer with mismatched dark theme; default visited purple.\n     - Notion/Figma\u2011like blocks with unmodified dividers/toggles; generic device frames; cookie\u2011cutter badges and pill buttons with identical shadows.\n   - Sloppy execution cues (2+ suggests sloppy_images or pull scores down):\n     - Inconsistent crops/aspect ratios; mixed/mismatched corner radii; aliasing/jaggies; compression or non\u2011retina blur.\n     - Screenshot readability issues (too zoomed out, moir\u00e9, tinted screen glares); inconsistent white balance across tiles.\n     - Shadow/border values fluctuate without logic; captions misaligned to tiles; stray 1\u20132px misalignments repeated across grid.\n   - Process soup cues:\n     - Long walls of sticky notes, personas, or unreadable timelines dominating above final visuals; deliverables with tiny text that cannot be evaluated; few or no polished product shots.\n\n10. Execution checklist before scoring (to sharpen critique):\n   - Typography: confirm measure/leading, link treatment, consistent scale steps, punctuation/quotes, and baseline rhythm; note any widows/orphans and orphan dates/labels.\n   - Layout & Composition: verify grid/gutter consistency, container width logic, alignment of repeated modules, optical centering of icons and bullets, and section separation.\n   - Color: check for tuned neutrals, accent role clarity, consistent state colors, value control in gradients, and whether mats/borders unify diverse imagery.\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn only valid JSON matching this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": \"X\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"typography\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"layout_composition\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    },\n    \"color\": {\n      \"score\": 1-5,\n      \"explanation\": \"detailed reasoning with specific evidence\",\n      \"confidence\": 1-5\n    }\n  },\n  \"red_flags\": [\"list any that apply\"],\n  \"overall_weighted_score\": calculated_number,\n  \"overall_confidence\": calculated_number\n}\n```\n\n## Scoring Calculation\n- base_score = (typography \u00d7 0.35) + (layout_composition \u00d7 0.35) + (color \u00d7 0.30)\n- penalty = sum of red flag penalties:\n  - template_scent_high: 0.5 points\n  - sloppy_images: 0.3 points\n  - process_soup: 0.2 points\n- overall_weighted_score = base_score - penalty\n- overall_confidence = average of individual dimension confidences\n\n---\n\n## RUBRIC\n\nFollow this rubric strictly. The \u201cScore 3\u201d rows define the competent baseline. Use 4\u20135 only when criteria are clearly met across multiple sections, or when a single view passes Rule 2.\n\n## Typography (Weight: 35%)\n\nWhat to examine (look closely and cite specifics):\n- Typeface quality (pro\u2011grade vs overused free), appropriateness, and pairing logic.\n- Hierarchy via scale ratios, weight, spacing, and tone\u2014not only bolding.\n- Readability: body 45\u201380ch; line\u2011height 1.3\u20131.7; display sizes tighter leading without collisions.\n- Consistency: heading levels, list styles, link treatment (underline thickness/offset), baseline rhythm, quote punctuation and apostrophes, superscripts/subscripts alignment.\n- Micro\u2011craft: optical kerning for all\u2011caps; punctuation spacing; small\u2011caps quality; number alignment; hyphenation/rag control.\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- A minimal style set produces rich, unmistakable hierarchy with impeccable rhythm across sections.\n- Pairing (or single family) shows mastery; details tuned (optical alignment, kerning, consistent cap/ascender spacing, hyphenation rules; no widows/orphans).\n- Distinctive typographic voice that feels bespoke yet highly readable. Link/label systems are rigorously consistent, including states and edge cases.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Clear hierarchy with restrained, consistent style usage; comfortable measures and leading.\n- Evident scale system (e.g., modular ratios) across multiple elements; link styling is customized and consistent or convincingly intentional even when conservative.\n- \u201cElevated basics\u201d allowed: default\u2011leaning blue and common system sans/serif can earn 4 if rhythm, measures, punctuation, and link treatment are disciplined and repeated across the page.\n- Minor issues only (e.g., a slightly hot link hue, one tight display line, a narrow rag).\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline\n- Readable with acceptable hierarchy and a limited style set.\n- Choices may feel generic (system sans + near\u2011default link blue) but aren\u2019t broken.\n- Some inconsistencies: heading levels too close, uneven bullet spacing, occasional baseline drift, a widow/orphan, inconsistent smart quotes, or an all\u2011italic block used without display tuning.\n\nScore 1\u20132: Below average / Poor\n- Style proliferation (too many sizes/weights) or flat hierarchy; random alignment of labels/dates.\n- Problematic measures (very long lines with airy leading, or cramped body); frequent widows/orphans; sloppy punctuation/superscripts; mixed straight/curly quotes.\n- Low\u2011quality or clashing fonts; mismatched display/body pairing; default underlines with uneven offset; mixed link styles in the same view.\n\nNegative indicators that should pull to 2:\n- Default link blue with thick default underline and no tuning; mixed serif/sans without logic; visible reflow collisions; inconsistent quotation marks/apostrophes; truncated lines or overlapping accents.\n\nHow to distinguish generic vs refined minimal type:\n- Refined: tuned neutrals; customized underline weight/offset; disciplined scale steps; stable baselines; optical alignment of icons/marks; consistent micro\u2011labels and dates; intentional hyphenation.\n- Generic: default link blue and underline; uneven paragraph spacing; arbitrary size jumps; mixed alignment without rationale; \u201clooks like Notion export\u201d with unmodified toggles/dividers.\n\n## Layout & Composition (Weight: 35%)\n\nWhat to examine:\n- Grid usage: columns, gutters, container widths; spacing system (multiples of 4/8/12).\n- Structural clarity: section breaks, scan patterns, focal points, navigation affordances.\n- Image presentation: consistent crops, device\u2011frame consistency or bespoke mats, matching radii/border weights/shadows.\n- Innovation with control: novel structures that aid comprehension; restraint that still shows a point of view.\n- Breadth of evidence: multiple sections vs single hero; consistency across the page and at visible breakpoints.\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Masterful structure with a clear POV that elevates clarity (inventive yet disciplined layouts, precise orchestration across columns/sections).\n- Immaculate rhythm and alignment at visible breakpoints; optical fixes applied for asymmetric content.\n- Assets are harmonized (radii, borders, shadows, captions) with flawless consistency across diverse content; complex grids remain legible and elegant.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Consistent grid and spacing; clear section hierarchy; strong alignment.\n- Image/asset handling is deliberate and cohesive; cards/tiles feel unified and intentional.\n- Long repeated grids are kept disciplined (identical mats, radii, caption positions, gutter rhythm).\n- Minor roughness allowed (one floaty element, a narrow gutter anomaly, or a single misaligned caption corrected elsewhere).\n- Important: Uniform card grids can earn 4 when mats/radii/spacing are notably refined and captions/labels are disciplined. Otherwise default to 3.\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline\n- Basic grid present and mostly consistent; sections are readable with adequate spacing.\n- Common patterns (single column, centered hero, simple card grid) executed decently but without sophistication or a clear POV.\n- Some inconsistencies in gutters, container widths, vertical rhythm, or image placement; default device frames with light tuning.\n\nScore 1\u20132: Below average / Poor\n- Random placement; competing focal points; inconsistent container widths with no rationale.\n- Haphazard screenshot handling; generic device mocks dominate; mixed radii/shadows; misaligned or missing captions.\n- Cramped or wasteful spacing obscuring hierarchy; obvious breakpoint issues (elements hugging edges or unexpected overflow).\n\nCommon deductions:\n- Evidence limited to a single hero or short view: cap at 3 unless Rule 2 passes.\n- \u201cClean but generic\u201d: centered hero + simple grid with soft shadows/rounded corners and no POV\u2014do not exceed 3 without visible refinement (precise rhythm, tuned mats, optical alignment).\n- Template modules repeated with no customization: cap at 3 and consider template_scent_high.\n\n## Color (Weight: 30%)\n\nWhat to examine:\n- Palette quality: harmony, hue/value control, and consistency across sections.\n- Neutrals: tuned greys/blacks; hue\u2011shifted borders and shadows; subtle overlays.\n- Accent strategy: scarcity and consistency; link/CTA states; role clarity.\n- Integration with imagery: does the shell unify diverse screenshots/tiles (mats, border tints, shadow logic, sequencing)?\n\nScore 5: Exceptional\n- Sophisticated palette with precise value control; accents sparse yet highly effective.\n- Neutrals and shadows are tuned; borders/overlays have intentional tints; color choices unify varied content effortlessly, including complex artwork.\n- Color expresses identity without noise, consistently across sections and states.\n\nScore 4: Strong\n- Harmonious palette with controlled accents; link/CTA system clearly defined or convincingly implied by consistent usage.\n- Neutrals intentionally tuned (off\u2011black/off\u2011white) supporting readability and hierarchy; gradients/illustrations sit comfortably within the system.\n- \u201cElevated basics\u201d acceptable: conservative blue accent can qualify for 4 when mats, borders, and greys are tuned and unify colorful content.\n- Minor issues only (one accent slightly hot, a single mismatched gradient, or limited state evidence).\n\nScore 3: Competent baseline\n- Serviceable palette; minimal shell with a single accent or defaultish link blue used acceptably.\n- When colorful tiles carry most color, the chrome does not clash but lacks unifying tactics (e.g., inconsistent mats/shadows/border tints) that would lift it to 4.\n- States may be missing but implied by stable patterns.\n\nScore 1\u20132: Below average / Poor\n- Too many hues without a throughline; inconsistent values; clashing gradients or noisy overlays.\n- Flat untuned greys; heavy default\u2011dark shadows; inaccessible text contrast; state colors inconsistent or contradictory.\n- Tile backgrounds with mismatched whites/greys that cause flicker across a grid.\n\nNegative indicators that should pull to 2:\n- Pure #000/#fff with harsh 0,0,255\u2011like blue; mismatched tile backgrounds; muddy overlays; random hover colors; inconsistent visited link behavior.\n\nHow to spot tuned vs default color in minimal pages:\n- Tuned: slightly desaturated or hue\u2011shifted blue; consistent underline thickness/offset; hover/visited handled or implied by a consistent pattern; off\u2011black/off\u2011white neutrals; very light, even dividers; unified mats/shadows around images.\n- Default: pure black/white; harsh default blues; generic heavy shadows; inconsistent border tints; tiles with different corner radii or shadow directions.\n\n## Red Flags\n\nFlag these when clearly present and reflect them in explanations.\n\n- template_scent_high:\n  - Obvious boilerplate patterns with minimal customization: centered hero with generic subhead + uniform card grid; stock \u201cAbout\u201d block; boilerplate footer; default link styles and underlines.\n  - Tokens that mirror popular UI kits without page\u2011level decisions: identical 12/16px radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues; identical card shadows; Inter/Roboto with untouched link defaults; Notion\u2011style layouts with unmodified toggles and dividers.\n  - Repeated canned sections with identical structure, no bespoke visual decisions, and no tuning of mats, shadows, or link treatments.\n\n- sloppy_images:\n  - Inconsistent crops/aspect ratios; mixed/mismatched corner radii; aliasing/jaggies; compression artifacts; non\u2011retina blurriness.\n  - Generic device frames without customization; screenshots too zoomed out or illegible; inconsistent mats/shadows/border weights; white\u2011balance mismatch across tiles.\n  - Misaligned captions/labels; inconsistent drop\u2011shadow directions; pixel wobble across a grid; partial screenshots with cut\u2011off UI.\n\n- process_soup:\n  - Long timelines/diagrams overwhelming final visuals; walls of sticky\u2011note photos overshadowing product.\n  - Persona/journey maps with unreadable small text; very little outcome imagery; excessive wireframes with no polished result.\n\nNote: Only add red flags when visual evidence is clear. If uncertain, omit the flag and reduce confidence instead.\n\n---\n\n## EXEMPLAR CALIBRATION\n\nUse these exemplar evaluations to calibrate your scoring. Prioritize the rubric; exemplars are anchors, not instructions. Use the full 1\u20135 range when warranted.
