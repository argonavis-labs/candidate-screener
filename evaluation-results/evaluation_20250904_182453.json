Being confident and wrong is bad.\n</evaluation_rules>\n\n<rubric>\n\n## Typography (weight = 35%)\n\n**Examine:**\nTypeface quality and appropriateness; pairing logic; hierarchy through scale/weight/spacing/tone (not just bold); readability (body **45\u201380 characters**, line height **1.3\u20131.7**, tighter for display without collisions); consistency (heading levels, lists, links including underline **thickness/offset**, baseline rhythm, quotes/apostrophes, superscript/subscript alignment, casing); micro\u2011craft (optical kerning in all\u2011caps, punctuation spacing, small\u2011caps quality, number alignment, rag/hyphen control).\n\n**Score 5 \u2014 Exceptional**\n\n* A minimal style set yields a rich, unmistakable hierarchy with impeccable rhythm across sections.\n* A single family or pairing is mastered; details are tuned (optical alignment, kerning, consistent ascender/cap spacing, intentional hyphenation, no widows/orphans, clean list indents).\n* A distinctive yet highly readable voice; links/labels are rigorously consistent, including states and edge cases.\n\n**Score 4 \u2014 Strong**\n\n* Clear hierarchy with restrained, consistent styles; measures and leading are comfortable across sections.\n* A visible scale system (e.g., modular ratios) spans multiple elements; link styling is customized and consistent or intentionally conservative.\n* **Common system faces can earn 4** when rhythm, measures, punctuation, casing, and link treatment are disciplined and repeat. Minor issues only.\n\n**Score 3 \u2014 Competent baseline**\n\n* Readable with adequate hierarchy using a limited style set; may feel generic.\n* Defaults (system sans + near\u2011default link blue) are acceptable but not broken.\n* Small inconsistencies may appear (close heading levels, uneven list indents, occasional baseline drift or widows/orphans, inconsistent smart quotes, one over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps, minor nav/hero mismatches).\n\n**Score 2 \u2014 Below average**\n\n* Multiple issues reduce clarity/polish: inconsistent casing; \u201ceverything bold\u201d; random word\u2011level bolding; emoji bullets that break rhythm; over\u2011indented lists; heavy dividers; random tracking or all\u2011caps; display/mono used for body; mixed fonts between buttons and body; default link styling with thick default underline; mixed link treatments; repeated widows/orphans or unstable baselines. Voice reads junior despite legibility.\n\n**Score 1 \u2014 Poor**\n\n* Flat or confusing hierarchy; style proliferation; unreadable measures (e.g., \\~90\u2013100ch hero); collisions/overlaps; inconsistent quotes/apostrophes; broken lists/labels.\n\n**Pull\u2011downs to 2 (or 1 if frequent):** default link blue with default underline; unreasoned serif/sans mixing; visible reflow collisions; mismatched button fonts or strokes; harsh, oversized nameplate in navigation.\n\n**Refined minimal vs generic minimal:**\n\n* **Refined**: tuned neutrals; customized underline weight/offset; disciplined scale steps; stable baselines; optical alignment of icons/marks; consistent micro\u2011labels/dates; intentional hyphenation; bullets align with text; consistent casing.\n* **Generic**: default link blue/underline; uneven paragraph spacing; arbitrary size jumps; mixed alignment without rationale; unmodified \u201cNotion\u2011export\u201d toggles/dividers; emoji bullets; oversized or over\u2011tracked all\u2011caps; nav/hero compete for scale.\n\n---\n\n## Layout (weight = 35%)\n\n**Examine:**\nGrid usage (columns, gutters, container widths) and spacing system (multiples of 4/8/12); structural clarity (sections, scan paths, focal points, navigation affordances); image presentation (consistent crops, device\u2011frame consistency or bespoke mats, matched radii/borders/shadows, readable screenshots); innovation with control (novel structures that aid comprehension); breadth of evidence across sections and visible breakpoints.\n\n**Score 5 \u2014 Exceptional**\n\n* Masterful, point\u2011of\u2011view structure that elevates clarity while remaining disciplined.\n* Immaculate rhythm and alignment at visible breakpoints; optical fixes for asymmetric content; long, complex grids stay in sync.\n* Assets are harmonized (radii, borders, shadows, captions) with flawless consistency; even large galleries maintain exact mats/captions/gutters.\n\n**Score 4 \u2014 Strong**\n\n* Consistent grid and spacing; clear section hierarchy; strong alignment across sections.\n* Image/asset handling is deliberate and cohesive; cards/tiles feel unified.\n* Long repeated grids are disciplined (identical mats, radii, caption positions, gutter rhythm). Minor roughness is acceptable.\n* Uniform card grids may earn 4 only when mats/radii/spacing are notably refined and captions/labels are disciplined. Considered collage can also earn 4 when gutters, baselines, and captions repeat exactly and no crops are cut off.\n\n**Score 3 \u2014 Competent baseline**\n\n* A basic grid is present and mostly consistent; sections are readable with adequate spacing.\n* Common patterns (single column, centered hero, simple card grid, left\u2011text/right\u2011image hero) are executed decently but without a clear point of view.\n* Some inconsistencies may appear (gutters, container widths, vertical rhythm, image placement); device frames show light tuning.\n\n**Score 2 \u2014 Below average**\n\n* Structural problems: drifting container widths without rationale; unexplained switches between centered and left alignment; awkward rags; floaty calls to action that ignore the grid; masonry/collage tiles with inconsistent whitespace or cut\u2011off crops; small unreadable screenshots in generic device mocks; mixed tile ratios that cause rhythm flicker; inconsistent internal mats; oversized headings that overpower content; misaligned buttons/captions; billboard backgrounds crowd real content. Layout feels like an uncustomized template.\n\n**Score 1 \u2014 Poor**\n\n* Random placement; competing focal points; inconsistent widths/gutters; severe readability issues.\n* Haphazard screenshot handling; inconsistent radii/shadows; elements hug edges or overflow at visible breakpoints.\n\n**Common deductions and caps:**\n\n* Evidence limited to a **single hero or short view \u2192 cap at 3**, unless **Single\u2011view Pass** applies.\n* \u201cClean but generic\u201d templates (centered hero + simple grid with soft shadows/rounded corners and no point of view) should **not exceed 3** without visible refinement.\n* Repeated template modules with little customization: **cap at 3** and note **template scent high**.\n* If **\u22653 sloppy\u2011image cues** (cut\u2011offs, unreadable mocks, mixed radii/crops), **cap Layout at 2** and pull **Color** down when value flicker comes from mismatched whites/mats.\n\n---\n\n## Color (weight = 30%)\n\n**Examine:**\nPalette quality (harmony, hue/value control, consistency); neutrals (tuned grays/blacks, hue\u2011shifted borders/shadows, subtle overlays); accent strategy (sparseness and role clarity, link/call\u2011to\u2011action states); integration with imagery (does the shell unify diverse screenshots via mats, border tints, shadow logic, and sequencing).\n\n**Score 5 \u2014 Exceptional**\n\n* A sophisticated palette with precise value control; accents are sparse yet effective.\n* Neutrals and shadows are tuned; borders/overlays have intentional tints; varied content is unified effortlessly, including complex artwork.\n* Color expresses identity without noise and remains consistent across sections and states.\n\n**Score 4 \u2014 Strong**\n\n* A harmonious palette with controlled accents; link/call\u2011to\u2011action logic is clear or strongly implied by usage.\n* Neutrals are intentionally tuned (off\u2011black/off\u2011white) to support readability and hierarchy; gradients/illustrations sit comfortably within the system.\n* Conservative blue accents can still earn 4 when mats, borders, and grays are tuned and unify colorful content. Minor issues only.\n\n**Score 3 \u2014 Competent baseline**\n\n* A serviceable palette; the shell uses a single accent or default\u2011ish link blue acceptably.\n* When colorful tiles carry most color, the chrome does not clash but lacks unifying tactics that would lift it to 4.\n* States may be missing but are implied by stable patterns.\n\n**Score 2 \u2014 Below average**\n\n* Too many hues or values with little throughline; loud tiles overpower a claimed single\u2011accent scheme.\n* Flat, untuned grays; stark #000/#fff pairs; default bright link blue; inconsistent state colors.\n* Mixed tile backgrounds or mismatched whites cause grid flicker; full\u2011color social icons/client logos add noise; unnecessary colored outlines.\n* Pastel mats are attempted but overwhelmed by saturated foregrounds; value jumps (e.g., a saturated footer) break the page\u2019s structure.\n\n**Score 1 \u2014 Poor**\n\n* Clashing gradients; muddy overlays; illegible contrast; chaotic color with no role clarity.\n\n**Pull\u2011downs to 2:** pure #000/#fff with harsh default blue; mismatched tile backgrounds; muddy overlays; random hover colors; inconsistent visited link behavior; pastel mats that fail to unify saturated UIs; noisy social/logo rows; aggressive value jumps.\n\n**Tuned minimal vs default minimal:**\n\n* **Tuned**: slightly desaturated or hue\u2011shifted blue; consistent underline thickness/offset; hover/visited handled or implied; off\u2011black/off\u2011white neutrals; very light, even dividers; unified mats/shadows.\n* **Default**: pure black/white; harsh default blues; heavy generic shadows; inconsistent border tints; tile radii/shadows that do not match; multicolor logos/emoji adding noise.\n\n---\n\n# Red flags\n\nFlag these when clearly present and reflect them in explanations.
