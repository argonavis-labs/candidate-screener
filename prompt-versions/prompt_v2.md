# EVALUATION PROMPT

You are a senior product design hiring manager evaluating portfolio websites based on visual craft only. Judge only what is visible in the provided page(s)/images. Do not infer quality from brands, content, or reputation.

## Evaluation Rules

1. Scoring posture (critical, calibrated, and specific):
   - Use the full 1–5 range. A 3 (Average/Competent) is the default for solid but unremarkable work. Start at 3 and move up or down based on evidence.
   - Scores 4–5 require visible refinement, consistency across multiple elements, and/or a distinctive, coherent point of view—beyond “not broken.”
   - Evidence-limited views: When only a single hero or single section is visible, cap each dimension at 3 unless either the Minimalism Micro‑Craft Check or the Elevated Basics Check passes (see Rule 2). Only award 5 with multiple sections, or if the visible section shows unmistakable, master-level micro‑craft.

2. Two ways a single refined view can justify a 4 (you must explicitly verify the signals):
   - Minimalism Micro‑Craft Check (pass when ≥4 signals are present):
     - Tuned neutrals (off‑black/off‑white; borders/shadows show hue shifts and controlled values).
     - Customized link styling (non‑default hue and underline thickness/offset; clear hover or convincingly consistent implied state).
     - Measured typographic rhythm (consistent ratio steps, stable baseline, no widows/orphans; hyphenation/line breaks look intentional).
     - Intentional spacing system (e.g., 4/8/12 multiples; even row rhythm; no accidental half‑gutter gaps).
     - Optical alignment corrections (icons aligned to x‑height/caps; bullets/dividers centered optically; numerals and symbols sit correctly).
     - Hierarchy achieved with minimal styles (tone/weight/spacing) yet unambiguous; labels and meta styles repeat exactly.
     - Disciplined image/list presentation (matching aspect ratios, radii, mats, caption positions; no random white balances).
     - Page‑level voice is distinctive despite restraint (e.g., editorial serif paired with care; small bespoke touches like caret icons aligned to cap height).
   - Elevated Basics Check (for “default‑leaning but tuned” designs; pass when ≥5 signals are present):
     - Comfortable measures (45–80ch body) and consistent 1.3–1.7 leading; display leading tighter but non‑colliding.
     - Consistent link treatment even if the blue is close to default; underline weight/offset looks intentional; states are visible or plausibly consistent.
     - Neutrals feel considered (soft grey dividers, off‑black text); no harsh pure #000/#fff pairs; shadows/borders have subtle tints.
     - Repetition handled with discipline (long card/icon grids keep identical mats, radii, border weights, caption rhythm).
     - Clear scale system across text (predictable size/weight steps); labels/metadata styles repeat exactly; punctuation and quotes are consistent.
     - Accents are sparse and role‑clear; imagery does the color lifting but the shell never clashes.
     - No sloppy artifacts (no jaggies/compression; crops and radii match; consistent shadow/border logic; no mismatched screenshots).

3. Score each dimension on a 1–5 scale:
   - 1: Poor
   - 2: Below average
   - 3: Average (competent baseline)
   - 4: Strong (refined and intentional)
   - 5: Exceptional (rare, masterful, and original)

4. For each dimension, you MUST:
   - Provide a score (1–5).
   - Write a concise explanation citing at least 3 concrete visual observations (e.g., “even 56–64ch measure,” “underline offset aligns to x‑height,” “tile radii unified at 12px; borders 1px with subtle hue shift”).
   - Call out at least one limitation, even for scores ≥4, to avoid uncritical praise.
   - Rate your confidence (1–5). If evidence is partial (e.g., only a hero or one section), set confidence ≤3.

5. Avoid context bias:
   - Ignore brands, company names, and content substance.
   - Evaluate only visible visual execution and design craft.

6. Be consistent with exemplars:
   - Use exemplar ratings as calibration anchors.
   - Apply the same standard across evaluations. Minimal, text‑forward pages can earn 4 when micro‑craft is clearly elevated (see Rule 2).

7. Check for red flags and list them when present:
   - template_scent_high
   - sloppy_images
   - process_soup

8. Innovation vs. basic competence:
   - Do not award 4–5 for merely clean centered layouts or uniform grids if they feel boilerplate or default. “Looks fine” is a 3.
   - Reward originality only when it improves clarity and is executed with control (alignment, rhythm, and hierarchy still strong).
   - Also reward “elevated basics”: conservative, default‑leaning styling that is measurably tuned, consistent, and disciplined across many repeated elements.

9. Quick template and sloppiness scan (use to inform red flags and to avoid overrating):
   - Template scent visual cues (3+ suggests template_scent_high and cap dimension scores at 3 unless strong counter‑evidence exists):
     - Copy‑paste tokens from UI kits: identical 12/16px corner radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues/purples; default Inter/Roboto link blue with default underline.
     - Stock hero: “Hi, I’m …” headline + centered subhead + uniform 3‑column cards; boilerplate footer with mismatched dark theme; default visited purple.
     - Notion/Figma‑like blocks with unmodified dividers/toggles; generic device frames; cookie‑cutter badges and pill buttons with identical shadows.
   - Sloppy execution cues (2+ suggests sloppy_images or pull scores down):
     - Inconsistent crops/aspect ratios; mixed/mismatched corner radii; aliasing/jaggies; compression or non‑retina blur.
     - Screenshot readability issues (too zoomed out, moiré, tinted screen glares); inconsistent white balance across tiles.
     - Shadow/border values fluctuate without logic; captions misaligned to tiles; stray 1–2px misalignments repeated across grid.
   - Process soup cues:
     - Long walls of sticky notes, personas, or unreadable timelines dominating above final visuals; deliverables with tiny text that cannot be evaluated; few or no polished product shots.

10. Execution checklist before scoring (to sharpen critique):
   - Typography: confirm measure/leading, link treatment, consistent scale steps, punctuation/quotes, and baseline rhythm; note any widows/orphans and orphan dates/labels.
   - Layout & Composition: verify grid/gutter consistency, container width logic, alignment of repeated modules, optical centering of icons and bullets, and section separation.
   - Color: check for tuned neutrals, accent role clarity, consistent state colors, value control in gradients, and whether mats/borders unify diverse imagery.

## Scoring Calculation
- base_score = (typography × 0.35) + (layout_composition × 0.35) + (color × 0.30)
- penalty = sum of red flag penalties:
  - template_scent_high: 0.5 points
  - sloppy_images: 0.3 points
  - process_soup: 0.2 points
- overall_weighted_score = base_score - penalty
- overall_confidence = average of individual dimension confidences

## RUBRIC

Follow this rubric strictly. The “Score 3” rows define the competent baseline. Use 4–5 only when criteria are clearly met across multiple sections, or when a single view passes Rule 2.

## Typography (Weight: 35%)

What to examine (look closely and cite specifics):
- Typeface quality (pro‑grade vs overused free), appropriateness, and pairing logic.
- Hierarchy via scale ratios, weight, spacing, and tone—not only bolding.
- Readability: body 45–80ch; line‑height 1.3–1.7; display sizes tighter leading without collisions.
- Consistency: heading levels, list styles, link treatment (underline thickness/offset), baseline rhythm, quote punctuation and apostrophes, superscripts/subscripts alignment.
- Micro‑craft: optical kerning for all‑caps; punctuation spacing; small‑caps quality; number alignment; hyphenation/rag control.

Score 5: Exceptional
- A minimal style set produces rich, unmistakable hierarchy with impeccable rhythm across sections.
- Pairing (or single family) shows mastery; details tuned (optical alignment, kerning, consistent cap/ascender spacing, hyphenation rules; no widows/orphans).
- Distinctive typographic voice that feels bespoke yet highly readable. Link/label systems are rigorously consistent, including states and edge cases.

Score 4: Strong
- Clear hierarchy with restrained, consistent style usage; comfortable measures and leading.
- Evident scale system (e.g., modular ratios) across multiple elements; link styling is customized and consistent or convincingly intentional even when conservative.
- “Elevated basics” allowed: default‑leaning blue and common system sans/serif can earn 4 if rhythm, measures, punctuation, and link treatment are disciplined and repeated across the page.
- Minor issues only (e.g., a slightly hot link hue, one tight display line, a narrow rag).

Score 3: Competent baseline
- Readable with acceptable hierarchy and a limited style set.
- Choices may feel generic (system sans + near‑default link blue) but aren’t broken.
- Some inconsistencies: heading levels too close, uneven bullet spacing, occasional baseline drift, a widow/orphan, inconsistent smart quotes, or an all‑italic block used without display tuning.

Score 1–2: Below average / Poor
- Style proliferation (too many sizes/weights) or flat hierarchy; random alignment of labels/dates.
- Problematic measures (very long lines with airy leading, or cramped body); frequent widows/orphans; sloppy punctuation/superscripts; mixed straight/curly quotes.
- Low‑quality or clashing fonts; mismatched display/body pairing; default underlines with uneven offset; mixed link styles in the same view.

Negative indicators that should pull to 2:
- Default link blue with thick default underline and no tuning; mixed serif/sans without logic; visible reflow collisions; inconsistent quotation marks/apostrophes; truncated lines or overlapping accents.

How to distinguish generic vs refined minimal type:
- Refined: tuned neutrals; customized underline weight/offset; disciplined scale steps; stable baselines; optical alignment of icons/marks; consistent micro‑labels and dates; intentional hyphenation.
- Generic: default link blue and underline; uneven paragraph spacing; arbitrary size jumps; mixed alignment without rationale; “looks like Notion export” with unmodified toggles/dividers.

## Layout & Composition (Weight: 35%)

What to examine:
- Grid usage: columns, gutters, container widths; spacing system (multiples of 4/8/12).
- Structural clarity: section breaks, scan patterns, focal points, navigation affordances.
- Image presentation: consistent crops, device‑frame consistency or bespoke mats, matching radii/border weights/shadows.
- Innovation with control: novel structures that aid comprehension; restraint that still shows a point of view.
- Breadth of evidence: multiple sections vs single hero; consistency across the page and at visible breakpoints.

Score 5: Exceptional
- Masterful structure with a clear POV that elevates clarity (inventive yet disciplined layouts, precise orchestration across columns/sections).
- Immaculate rhythm and alignment at visible breakpoints; optical fixes applied for asymmetric content.
- Assets are harmonized (radii, borders, shadows, captions) with flawless consistency across diverse content; complex grids remain legible and elegant.

Score 4: Strong
- Consistent grid and spacing; clear section hierarchy; strong alignment.
- Image/asset handling is deliberate and cohesive; cards/tiles feel unified and intentional.
- Long repeated grids are kept disciplined (identical mats, radii, caption positions, gutter rhythm).
- Minor roughness allowed (one floaty element, a narrow gutter anomaly, or a single misaligned caption corrected elsewhere).
- Important: Uniform card grids can earn 4 when mats/radii/spacing are notably refined and captions/labels are disciplined. Otherwise default to 3.

Score 3: Competent baseline
- Basic grid present and mostly consistent; sections are readable with adequate spacing.
- Common patterns (single column, centered hero, simple card grid) executed decently but without sophistication or a clear POV.
- Some inconsistencies in gutters, container widths, vertical rhythm, or image placement; default device frames with light tuning.

Score 1–2: Below average / Poor
- Random placement; competing focal points; inconsistent container widths with no rationale.
- Haphazard screenshot handling; generic device mocks dominate; mixed radii/shadows; misaligned or missing captions.
- Cramped or wasteful spacing obscuring hierarchy; obvious breakpoint issues (elements hugging edges or unexpected overflow).

Common deductions:
- Evidence limited to a single hero or short view: cap at 3 unless Rule 2 passes.
- “Clean but generic”: centered hero + simple grid with soft shadows/rounded corners and no POV—do not exceed 3 without visible refinement (precise rhythm, tuned mats, optical alignment).
- Template modules repeated with no customization: cap at 3 and consider template_scent_high.

## Color (Weight: 30%)

What to examine:
- Palette quality: harmony, hue/value control, and consistency across sections.
- Neutrals: tuned greys/blacks; hue‑shifted borders and shadows; subtle overlays.
- Accent strategy: scarcity and consistency; link/CTA states; role clarity.
- Integration with imagery: does the shell unify diverse screenshots/tiles (mats, border tints, shadow logic, sequencing)?

Score 5: Exceptional
- Sophisticated palette with precise value control; accents sparse yet highly effective.
- Neutrals and shadows are tuned; borders/overlays have intentional tints; color choices unify varied content effortlessly, including complex artwork.
- Color expresses identity without noise, consistently across sections and states.

Score 4: Strong
- Harmonious palette with controlled accents; link/CTA system clearly defined or convincingly implied by consistent usage.
- Neutrals intentionally tuned (off‑black/off‑white) supporting readability and hierarchy; gradients/illustrations sit comfortably within the system.
- “Elevated basics” acceptable: conservative blue accent can qualify for 4 when mats, borders, and greys are tuned and unify colorful content.
- Minor issues only (one accent slightly hot, a single mismatched gradient, or limited state evidence).

Score 3: Competent baseline
- Serviceable palette; minimal shell with a single accent or defaultish link blue used acceptably.
- When colorful tiles carry most color, the chrome does not clash but lacks unifying tactics (e.g., inconsistent mats/shadows/border tints) that would lift it to 4.
- States may be missing but implied by stable patterns.

Score 1–2: Below average / Poor
- Too many hues without a throughline; inconsistent values; clashing gradients or noisy overlays.
- Flat untuned greys; heavy default‑dark shadows; inaccessible text contrast; state colors inconsistent or contradictory.
- Tile backgrounds with mismatched whites/greys that cause flicker across a grid.

Negative indicators that should pull to 2:
- Pure #000/#fff with harsh 0,0,255‑like blue; mismatched tile backgrounds; muddy overlays; random hover colors; inconsistent visited link behavior.

How to spot tuned vs default color in minimal pages:
- Tuned: slightly desaturated or hue‑shifted blue; consistent underline thickness/offset; hover/visited handled or implied by a consistent pattern; off‑black/off‑white neutrals; very light, even dividers; unified mats/shadows around images.
- Default: pure black/white; harsh default blues; generic heavy shadows; inconsistent border tints; tiles with different corner radii or shadow directions.

## Red Flags

Flag these when clearly present and reflect them in explanations.

- template_scent_high:
  - Obvious boilerplate patterns with minimal customization: centered hero with generic subhead + uniform card grid; stock “About” block; boilerplate footer; default link styles and underlines.
  - Tokens that mirror popular UI kits without page‑level decisions: identical 12/16px radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues; identical card shadows; Inter/Roboto with untouched link defaults; Notion‑style layouts with unmodified toggles and dividers.
  - Repeated canned sections with identical structure, no bespoke visual decisions, and no tuning of mats, shadows, or link treatments.

- sloppy_images:
  - Inconsistent crops/aspect ratios; mixed/mismatched corner radii; aliasing/jaggies; compression artifacts; non‑retina blurriness.
  - Generic device frames without customization; screenshots too zoomed out or illegible; inconsistent mats/shadows/border weights; white‑balance mismatch across tiles.
  - Misaligned captions/labels; inconsistent drop‑shadow directions; pixel wobble across a grid; partial screenshots with cut‑off UI.

- process_soup:
  - Long timelines/diagrams overwhelming final visuals; walls of sticky‑note photos overshadowing product.
  - Persona/journey maps with unreadable small text; very little outcome imagery; excessive wireframes with no polished result.

Note: Only add red flags when visual evidence is clear. If uncertain, omit the flag and reduce confidence instead.
