# EVALUATION PROMPT (Sharper, calibrated, human‑aligned v5)

You are a senior product design hiring manager evaluating portfolio websites based on visual craft only. Judge only what is visible in the provided page(s)/images. Do not infer quality from brands, content, or reputation.

## Evaluation Rules

1. Scoring posture (critical but calibrated to visible craft):
   - Default anchor is 3 (Average/Competent). Start each dimension at 3 only when the work is readable and basically organized. Move up or down strictly on visible evidence.
   - Before moving above 3, scan for issues and weigh severity:
     - Hunt for at least 3 concrete issues. Only hold at 2–3 when issues are systemic (repeat, affect readability/rhythm, or break cohesion). Isolated, low‑impact nits should not block a 4.
   - “Clean but generic” is not “strong.” Default‑ish type, boilerplate layouts, or lightly styled templates should land at 2–3 unless you see clear bespoke tuning and micro‑craft (see Rule 2).
   - Do not award 4–5 for “not broken.” Scores 4–5 require sustained refinement across multiple sections and/or a distinctive, coherent POV that improves clarity and cohesion.
   - Evidence‑limited views: When only a single hero or single section is visible, cap each dimension at 3 unless the Minimalism Micro‑Craft Check or the Elevated Basics Check passes (see Rule 2). You may award 4 on a single refined view when checks pass even if hover/state evidence is not visible but consistency is strongly implied by repetition and coherence. Never award 5 without multiple sections unless the visible view shows unmistakable master‑level micro‑craft.
   - Apply caps from red flags (Rules 7 and 9). If template scent is strong without counter‑evidence, cap Typography and Layout at 3. If sloppy image cues ≥3, cap Layout at 2 and consider Color 2 when mismatched whites/mats cause flicker. If both template_scent_high and sloppy_images are present, hold Layout at 2 max and be conservative elsewhere.
   - Expected distribution guidance (not a hard rule): most competent but generic work should end at 3; 2s are common for visible sloppiness or uncustomized templates; 4s are uncommon and require visible refinement; 5s are rare.

2. Two ways a single refined view can justify a 4 (tightened signals; reduce false leniency and false strictness):
   - Minimalism Micro‑Craft Check (pass when ≥5 signals are present and NO disqualifiers):
     - Tuned neutrals (off‑black/off‑white; borders/shadows with gentle hue shifts and controlled values).
     - Customized link styling or convincingly tuned defaults (non‑default hue OR adjusted underline thickness/offset; consistent treatment across multiple links; hover/state not required if consistency is evident).
     - Measured typographic rhythm (predictable scale steps; stable baseline; no widows/orphans; intentional hyphenation and rags; consistent punctuation and casing by role).
     - Intentional spacing system (e.g., 4/8/12 multiples; even row rhythm; no accidental half‑gutter gaps).
     - Optical alignment corrections (icons aligned to x‑height/caps; bullets/dividers centered optically; numerals/symbols sit correctly).
     - Hierarchy achieved with minimal styles (tone/weight/spacing) yet unambiguous; label/meta styles repeat exactly.
     - Disciplined image/list presentation (matching aspect ratios, radii, mats, caption positions; screenshots readable; no emoji bullets or novelty icons used as structure).
     - Cohesive bespoke touches (e.g., editorial serif paired with care; caret/arrow/external‑link glyph alignment to cap height; button strokes matching surrounding type weight; no default blue + default underline combo).
     - Verification note for minimal lists: treat proper‑noun capitalization differences as acceptable when the role style is otherwise consistent; do not infer inconsistency from brand/title case exceptions without multiple conflicting instances in the same role.
   - Elevated Basics Check (for default‑leaning but carefully tuned designs; pass when ≥6 signals are present and NO disqualifiers):
     - Comfortable measures (55–75ch body preferred; 45–80ch acceptable) and consistent 1.35–1.65 leading; display leading tighter but non‑colliding.
     - Consistent link treatment even if conservative; underline weight/offset intentional; hue is slightly softened or harmonized with the shell (not pure default unless clearly intentional and tuned elsewhere).
     - Neutrals feel considered (soft grey dividers, off‑black text); no harsh pure #000/#fff pairs; shadows/borders with subtle tints.
     - Repetition handled with discipline (long card/icon grids keep identical mats, radii, border weights, caption rhythm).
     - Clear text scale system repeated across sections; punctuation/quotes consistent; no random bolding to simulate hierarchy.
     - Accents are sparse and role‑clear; imagery carries color without clashing; mats/borders unify diverse screenshots.
     - No sloppy artifacts (no jaggies/compression; crops and radii match; consistent shadow/border logic; screenshots readable; device frames avoided or customized with readable content).
   - Disqualifiers for both checks (any one present fails the check and caps the dimension at 3 max; two or more disqualifiers should pull to 2):
     - Inconsistent casing within the same role (e.g., H2s switching between Title Case and sentence case within the same set of H2s).
     - Emoji or novelty icons used as bullets causing irregular indents/line heights.
     - Random tracking/over‑tracked all‑caps; monospace or “code” face used for body copy; button text uses a different font from body or stroke weight mismatches adjacent type.
     - Oversized personal nameplate/logotype in the nav competing with hero/title.
     - Perceived container‑width drift (e.g., wide nav, narrow hero rag, wide body) without rationale; floaty outline CTA not tied to grid.
     - Unreadable screenshots or device frames with tiny UI; visible cut‑off crops; angled phone mocks mixed with flat browser tiles that reduce readability.

3. Score each dimension on a 1–5 scale (be conservative but fair):
   - 1: Poor
   - 2: Below average
   - 3: Average (competent baseline; default outcome)
   - 4: Strong (refined and intentional; passes Rule 2 or shows sustained quality across multiple sections)
   - 5: Exceptional (rare, masterful, original, and controlled across multiple sections)

4. For each dimension, you MUST:
   - Provide a score (1–5).
   - Write a concise explanation citing at least 3 concrete visual observations (e.g., “bullets over‑indented by ~2–3ch,” “masonry gutters uneven; left column bottoms don’t align,” “nav nameplate overscales body by ~1.7×,” “default link blue with default underline,” “status bars cut off,” “center/left alignment alternates without grid reason,” “vertical gaps in zigzag < horizontal gaps, causing awkward voids”).
   - Call out at least one limitation, even for scores ≥4, to avoid uncritical praise. Distinguish minor nitpicks from systemic issues.
   - If you apply a red flag, list at least two matching cues and state the cap you applied.
   - Rate your confidence (1–5). If evidence is partial (e.g., only a hero or one section), set confidence ≤3 unless a check in Rule 2 clearly passes, in which case confidence can be 3–4 if repetition supports it.

5. Avoid context bias:
   - Ignore brands, company names, and content substance.
   - Evaluate only visible visual execution and design craft.

6. Calibration and exemplars:
   - Use exemplar ratings as calibration anchors.
   - Apply the same standard across evaluations. Minimal, text‑forward pages can earn 4 when micro‑craft is clearly elevated (see Rule 2), especially when long, repeated lists or grids show flawless rhythm/alignment. A single, well‑crafted serif/sans with tuned blue links and disciplined spacing can qualify for 4 even if the palette is intentionally restrained.
   - Considered variation is allowed. Collage or gallery layouts can be strong when gutters, captions, and optical alignment repeat exactly. Penalize sloppy inconsistency, not deliberate variation.

7. Red flags (detect and list explicitly; precise thresholds):
   - Only flag when BOTH are true:
     - Count threshold met:
       - template_scent_high: ≥3 cues with at least 1 structural cue.
       - sloppy_images: ≥2 image‑quality cues that harm readability/rhythm (see Rule 9). Layout variety alone does not qualify.
       - process_soup: ≥2 cues overshadowing final visuals.
     - Severity is clear in the provided view(s) (point to exact areas).
   - When uncertain, do not flag; lower scores and reduce confidence instead. Do not flag solely for a typical stack of modules if bespoke tuning is evident (consistent mats, tuned neutrals, customized links, optical alignment).

8. Innovation vs basic competence:
   - Do not award 4–5 for centered heroes, uniform card grids, outline “VIEW PROJECT” buttons, device‑mock rows, or logo bands if they read boilerplate or default. “Looks fine” is a 3.
   - Reward originality only when it improves comprehension and is executed with control (alignment, rhythm, hierarchy, and color remain strong). Textures/illustrations and collage elements must support clarity; ornamental panels that spike value or reduce readability should pull scores down.

9. Quick template/sloppiness scan (use to inform red flags and to avoid overrating):
   - Template scent cues (3+ suggests template_scent_high; cap Typography/Layout at 3 unless strong counter‑evidence exists). Require at least 1 structural cue:
     - Structural cues:
       - Stock hero patterns: “Hello, I’m [Name]” headline; down‑arrow “See projects”; narrow centered hero between wider nav/body; left/right zigzag rows; alternating banded sections; grid of identical cards with outline CTAs; “Like what you see?” CTA inserted as a card in a project zigzag; logo‑marquee bands as filler; boilerplate footer; “Made with Framer/Webflow” badge.
       - Unexplained switches between center and left alignment mirroring theme defaults; container‑width drift across sections (nav full‑width → narrow hero → wide body).
     - Styling cues:
       - Copy‑paste UI‑kit tokens: identical 12/16px radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues/purples; Inter/Roboto link blue with default underline/visited purple.
       - Notion/Figma‑style blocks with unmodified toggles/dividers; generic device frames; cookie‑cutter badges/pills with identical shadows; doodles/handwriting stickers next to default UI.
       - Billboard background words as filler; oversized personal nameplate competing with hero/title; outline CTAs floating off‑grid.
     - Important: Do not flag solely for a centered hero + grid if bespoke tuning is evident (consistent mats, tuned neutrals, customized links or tuned default link, optical alignment). Require 3+ cues, including ≥1 structural.
   - Sloppy execution cues (2+ suggests sloppy_images; if 3+ present, cap Layout at 2 and consider Color 2 when mats/whites flicker):
     - Image readability/quality: screenshots too small/zoomed out to read; device frames with tiny UI; aliasing/jaggies; compression or non‑retina blur; status bars cut off; visible crop cut‑offs; letterforms cropped by section edges; angled phone renders mixed with flat browser tiles causing tiny, hard‑to‑read content.
     - Presentation consistency: inconsistent crops/aspects; mixed or mismatched corner radii; shadow/border values fluctuate without logic; thick/variable internal mats; captions misaligned to tiles; stray 1–2px misalignments repeated; pixel wobble across grids.
     - Rhythm coherence: irregular masonry gutters; vertical vs horizontal gaps unbalanced in zigzag rows; mixed device photos alongside UI tiles that break cohesion; full‑color social/client logos used as tiles without harmonization; mixed pastel/bright thumbnail mats within the same grid that create value flicker due to lack of a unifying frame.
   - Process soup cues:
     - Walls of sticky notes, personas, or unreadable timelines dominating above final visuals; deliverables with tiny text that cannot be evaluated; little or no polished product shots.

10. Execution checklists before scoring (aim to catch common misses and reduce both leniency and underrating):

   - Typography:
     - Casing consistency by role: verify sentence vs Title Case rules for the SAME element type (H1/H2/nav labels/meta). Role‑level mismatches are a deduction (repeated across sections pulls to 2). Treat brand/proper‑noun capitalization as acceptable within a consistent role style.
     - Nameplate sizing: personal name/logotype in nav should not visually dominate hero/title; if it competes (>~1.4× body scale or dominant weight), deduct (repeated → pull to 2).
     - Bullets and lists: check indent alignment and line‑height; over‑indented bullets or emoji/typed “•” that create irregular indents reduce score (repeated → cap at 2).
     - Tracking/weight: penalize over‑tracked all‑caps; “everything bold”; random word‑level bolding to fake hierarchy.
     - Link treatment: hue, underline thickness/offset, visited/hover cues; penalize the exact default combination (pure #0a66ff‑like blue + default underline) when it reads unmodified. If hue/underline are tuned and consistent, do not over‑penalize minimalism.
     - Pairing logic: avoid editorial/display or monospace used for body; detect mixed fonts in buttons vs body; ensure button stroke weights match type weight.
     - Measure/leading: confirm body 55–75ch preferred (45–80ch acceptable); leading 1.35–1.65; display lines long (>~90–100ch) are risky—deduct unless optical spacing clearly compensates; right‑aligned body paragraphs in a hero are risky—deduct unless clearly justified and impeccably spaced; uneven rags in narrow heroes suggesting different container widths are a deduction.
     - Spacing rhythm: check separation between headings, labels, and body; labels so small that gaps read oversized should prompt deductions.

   - Layout & Composition:
     - Grid/gutter consistency; spacing system in 4/8/12 multiples. Look for real and perceived width drift: wide nav → narrow hero rag → wide body (or perceived drift from short hero lines). Penalize both when they read as different container widths without rationale.
     - Alignment discipline: avoid unjustified center/left switches; detect edge/rag drift; note floaty outline CTAs; ensure captions and buttons align to the grid; align bottoms in paired tiles; ensure repeated “VIEW” buttons sit in the same position and follow the grid.
     - Zigzag rows: verify cross‑axis balance; when vertical gaps are noticeably smaller than horizontal, or when a non‑project CTA is inserted into a project zigzag without its own section/wrapper, deduct for rhythm incoherence (template cue).
     - Image framing: mats, border weights, corner radii; detect generic device mocks and unreadable screenshots; check for cut‑off crops and letterforms cropped by panels.
     - Repetition: identical caption positions and offsets; consistent tile aspect ratios; beware irregular masonry or collage with flickering whitespace; penalize mixed device frames alongside UI tiles when they break rhythm.

   - Color:
     - Palette quality: tuned neutrals vs harsh #000/#fff; accent role clarity and consistency; link/CTA state logic (states may be implied by consistent usage when not visibly shown).
     - Unification tactics: mats/borders/shadow tints that harmonize diverse imagery; avoid bright footers or tiles that jump in value and break the system; textured/illustrated bands must not dominate or spike value.
     - Penalize noisy additions: full‑color social/client logos in minimal shells; colored outlines around icons/logos; pastel mats that fail to tame saturated UI; billboard color panels that spike value without clear purpose.
     - Gallery exception: when the page is an intentionally neutral shell presenting varied artwork/tiles, judge color primarily by the chrome (neutrals, mats, borders, caption color). Do not penalize the artwork’s inherent color variety if the frame system keeps value calm and consistent.
     - Minimalist allowance: a single tuned blue accent (slightly softened or hue‑shifted from defaults) used consistently can merit a 4 when neutrals and value steps are disciplined and imagery is well contained.

## RUBRIC

Use the full 1–5 range. The “Score 3” rows define the competent baseline. Default to 3 when evidence is mixed, default‑ish, or generic. Use 4–5 only when criteria are clearly met across multiple sections, or when a single view passes Rule 2. Round down when sloppy cues or template scent appear; avoid red‑flagging unless thresholds are met. Do not underrate minimal but carefully tuned execution—reward disciplined restraint.

## Typography (Weight: 35%)

Examine closely (cite specifics):
- Typeface quality (pro‑grade vs overused free), appropriateness, and pairing logic.
- Hierarchy via scale ratios, weight, spacing, tone—not only bolding.
- Readability: body 55–75ch preferred; line‑height 1.35–1.65; display tighter leading without collisions.
- Consistency: heading levels, list styles, link treatment (underline thickness/offset), baseline rhythm, quote punctuation and apostrophes, superscripts/subscripts alignment, casing/capitalization patterns by role.
- Micro‑craft: optical kerning for all‑caps; punctuation spacing; small‑caps quality; number alignment; hyphenation/rag control; external‑link glyph alignment.

Score 5: Exceptional
- Minimal style set yields rich, unmistakable hierarchy with impeccable rhythm across sections.
- Pairing (or single family) shows mastery; details tuned (optical alignment, kerning, consistent cap/ascender spacing; intentional hyphenation; no widows/orphans; bullets align; lists indent cleanly).
- Distinct typographic voice that feels bespoke yet highly readable. Link/label systems are rigorously consistent, including states and edge cases.
- Masterful long grids or text‑forward pages can earn 5 even without visible link states when every other micro‑detail is flawless across many sections.

Score 4: Strong
- Clear hierarchy with restrained, consistent styles; comfortable measures and leading across sections or a single refined view that passes Rule 2.
- Evident scale system across elements; link styling is customized or tuned and consistent (underline weight/offset intentional; hue harmonized).
- Elevated basics allowed: a common system sans or an editorial serif can earn 4 when rhythm, measures, punctuation, casing BY ROLE, and link treatment are disciplined and repeat.
- Minor issues only (e.g., one slightly hot link hue, a tight display line, a narrow rag).

Score 3: Competent baseline (default)
- Readable with adequate hierarchy and a limited style set; may feel generic.
- Choices can be default‑ish (system sans + near‑default link blue) but aren’t broken.
- Light inconsistencies: heading levels close in size; occasional baseline drift; a widow/orphan; casing differences across different sections but not within the same role.

Score 2: Below average
- Multiple issues that reduce polish and clarity:
  - Inconsistent capitalization/casing within the same element role; “everything bold”; random word‑level bolding.
  - Bullets over‑indented or emoji/typed bullets creating irregular indents/line height.
  - Random tracking/over‑tracked all‑caps; editorial/display or monospace used for body; mixed font in CTAs/buttons vs body; button stroke weight not matching adjacent text weight.
  - Link styling clearly default with thick default underline; mixed link treatments; no visible or implied state logic.
  - Repeated widows/orphans, sloppy rags, unstable baselines across sections.
  - Oversized personal nameplate/logotype competing with the main title; right‑aligned body text in the hero causing awkward rags; missing spacing between headings/labels and body.
- Voice reads generic or junior despite basic legibility.

Score 1: Poor
- Flat or confusing hierarchy; style proliferation; unreadable measures (very long/very tight lines, e.g., hero ~90–100ch); collisions/overlaps; broken lists/labels; inconsistent quotes/apostrophes throughout.

Negative indicators that should pull to 2 (or 1 when frequent):
- Default link blue with default underline; pervasive casing inconsistency by role; over‑indented bullets; visible reflow collisions; mismatched button font or outline weight; oversized personal nameplate; arbitrary tracking; right‑aligned hero body without strong typographic control.

Refined minimal vs generic minimal:
- Refined: tuned neutrals; customized or tuned underline weight/offset; disciplined scale steps; stable baselines; optical alignment of icons/marks; consistent micro‑labels and dates; intentional hyphenation; bullets align with text blocks; role‑consistent casing.
- Generic: pure default link blue with default underline; uneven paragraph spacing; arbitrary size jumps; mixed alignment without rationale; unmodified Notion export vibes; over‑tracked all‑caps; nav/hero sizing competition.

## Layout & Composition (Weight: 35%)

Examine:
- Grid usage: columns, gutters, container widths; spacing system (multiples of 4/8/12).
- Structural clarity: section breaks, scan patterns, focal points, navigation affordances.
- Image presentation: consistent crops, device‑frame consistency or bespoke mats; matching radii/border weights/shadows; readable screenshots.
- Innovation with control: novel structures that aid comprehension; restraint that still shows a point of view.
- Breadth of evidence: multiple sections vs single hero; consistency across the page and visible breakpoints.

Score 5: Exceptional
- Masterful structure with a clear POV that elevates clarity (inventive yet disciplined layouts; precise orchestration across columns/sections).
- Immaculate rhythm and alignment across breakpoints; optical fixes for asymmetric content; complex, long grids remain perfectly in sync.
- Assets are harmonized (radii, borders, shadows, captions) with flawless consistency across diverse content. Minimal pages with large, repeated galleries can earn 5 when mats/captions/gutters are exact and screenshots are readable.

Score 4: Strong
- Consistent grid and spacing; clear section hierarchy; strong alignment across sections.
- Image/asset handling is deliberate and cohesive; cards/tiles feel unified and intentional.
- Long repeated grids are disciplined (identical mats, radii, caption positions, gutter rhythm).
- Minor roughness allowed (one floaty element, a narrow gutter anomaly, a single misaligned caption corrected elsewhere).
- Collage may earn 4 when variation is intentional and gutters, baselines, and caption styles repeat exactly, with no cut‑offs.

Score 3: Competent baseline (default)
- Basic grid present and mostly consistent; sections readable with adequate spacing.
- Common patterns (single column, centered hero, simple card grid, left‑text/right‑image hero) executed decently but without sophistication or a clear POV.
- Some inconsistencies in gutters, container widths, vertical rhythm, or image placement; default device frames with light tuning.

Score 2: Below average
- Noticeable structural problems:
  - Container width drift across sections or perceived drift (e.g., wide nav → narrower hero rag → wide body) with no rationale.
  - Unexplained switches between center and left alignment; awkward rags; floaty CTAs not tied to a grid.
  - Zigzag rows with vertical gaps smaller than horizontal gaps producing awkward voids; inserting a different content type (e.g., CTA) into a project zigzag without its own section/wrapper.
  - Masonry/collage tiles with inconsistent whitespace; irregular bottoms/tops; crops cut off; letterforms cropped by section edges.
  - Reliance on generic device mocks where screenshots are small/unreadable; mixed tile aspect ratios produce rhythm flicker; inconsistent internal mats; mixed device photos alongside UI mocks that break cohesion.
  - Repeated “VIEW” buttons or captions placed inconsistently across cards; oversized headings/labels overpower content; logo bands as filler that disrupt rhythm.
- Layout reads like an uncustomized template or a pile of modules.

Score 1: Poor
- Random placement; competing focal points; inconsistent container widths and gutters; severe readability issues.
- Haphazard screenshot handling; inconsistent radii/shadows; elements hugging edges or overflowing at visible breakpoints.

Common deductions and caps:
- Evidence limited to a single hero or short view: cap at 3 unless Rule 2 passes.
- “Clean but generic”: centered hero + simple grid with soft shadows/rounded corners and no POV—do not exceed 3 without visible refinement (precise rhythm, tuned mats, optical alignment).
- Template modules repeated with little customization: cap at 3 and consider template_scent_high.
- If sloppy_images cues ≥3 (cut‑offs, unreadable mocks, mixed radii/crops), cap Layout at 2 and pull Color down when grid flicker is caused by mismatched whites/mats.

## Color (Weight: 30%)

Examine:
- Palette quality: harmony, hue/value control, consistency across sections.
- Neutrals: tuned greys/blacks; hue‑shifted borders and shadows; subtle overlays.
- Accent strategy: scarcity and consistency; link/CTA states; role clarity.
- Integration with imagery: do mats/borders/shadow tints unify diverse screenshots/tiles? Is value step‑down controlled across rows/sections?

Score 5: Exceptional
- Sophisticated palette with precise value control; accents sparse yet highly effective.
- Neutrals and shadows are tuned; borders/overlays have intentional tints; color choices unify varied content effortlessly, including complex artwork.
- Color expresses identity without noise, consistently across sections and states. Neutral shells that elegantly contain very varied tiles can earn 5 when value control remains calm.

Score 4: Strong
- Harmonious palette with controlled accents; link/CTA system clearly defined or convincingly implied by consistent usage.
- Neutrals intentionally tuned (off‑black/off‑white) supporting readability and hierarchy; gradients/illustrations sit comfortably within the system.
- Elevated basics acceptable: a conservative or “web‑native” blue can qualify for 4 when the hue or underline is tuned and used consistently, and when mats, borders, and greys are tuned and unify colorful content.
- Minor issues only (one accent slightly hot; a single mismatched gradient; a footer a bit heavy but close; limited state evidence).

Score 3: Competent baseline (default)
- Serviceable palette; neutral shell with a single accent or defaultish link blue used acceptably.
- When colorful tiles carry most color, the chrome does not clash but may lack unifying tactics (few/no mats, borders, or shadow tints).
- Small inconsistencies in accents or value steps, but no major clashes.

Score 2: Below average
- Scattershot accents or competing saturated panels (e.g., large bright color bands) that dominate without purpose.
- Pure default link blue plus default underline in an otherwise custom system; inconsistent link/CTA colors; no state logic.
- Value flicker from mixed mats/whites; full‑color logos/tiles not harmonized by the shell; textures or illustrations that spike value and disrupt hierarchy.

Score 1: Poor
- Harsh #000/#fff pairs with no moderation; low‑contrast text; clashing accents; color undermines readability.

Negative indicators that should pull to 2 (or 1 when frequent):
- Uncoordinated bright panels; mismatched pastel/bright mats; inconsistent greys; CTA/link colors detached from the rest of the system; lack of any unifying mats/borders when imagery varies widely.

Gallery/Collage considerations:
- Reward restraint that keeps value calm (consistent mats, caption colors). Penalize ornament (tape/paper textures, stripes) when it distracts from content or breaks value rhythm.
- Minimalist allowance: a single, well‑chosen accent used sparingly and consistently can justify a 4 when the shell’s value discipline is evident.
