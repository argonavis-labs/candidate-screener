Let's talk.' in Title Case). 3) Link/CTA treatments are mixed\u2014blue text links with arrows ('Case Study \u2192', 'Contact Us \u2192') coexist with heavy black pill buttons ('Book a Discovery Call'), creating uneven typographic voice and contrast. 4) Logo row and testimonial captions use very small meta text relative to large headlines, producing a jumpy scale.

Some of them even don't have a body, whereas others have a body and a title. They also kept the logos of the people that they work with really big, and every logo is a different type. Again, makes it really noisy. ",

        "color": "There are too many colors going on here, it's kind of a disaster.\n- There's an attempt at doing a pastel color background for all the images, but because there's so many colors in the UI in the foreground, it effectively loses the effect.\n- They also kept all the logos of the clients they work with really big, and because all the logos have different colors too, it just totally takes away from the intended effect of the pastel palette.\n- There's also some really awkward examples of color usage at the very bottom of the page where they've used full-color social logos (which is already a lot) and on top of it, they've chosen to use a colored outline in teal, which is like tons of color that doesn't mean anything and in a place where it's probably not very important to draw attention to.

Evidence of inconsistency and limited tuning keeps it at the competent baseline: 1) Case-study titles mix casing by the same role (e.g., 'Checkout Flow Redesign' vs 'Designing a health curriculum' vs 'ATS Integration'). 2) 'OTHER PROJECTS' is oversized and heavy, jumping the hierarchy and competing with surrounding content. 3) Nav uses plain links with no visible custom states/underline treatment; overall link styling reads defaultish. Positives: micro\u2011labels in small caps appear consistent, measures/leading are comfortable, and the nameplate in the nav does not dominate. Limitation: states, hover, and deeper text rhythms are not visible from this single view.",

Applied red flag sloppy_images (cap Layout at 2) based on: unreadable screenshots across several tiles, visible crop/black strip artifact, and mixed device/asset presentation causing rhythm flicker. Limitation: only one page view; cannot assess responsive behavior.",

But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. ",

Links are consistently teal with underlines, and list indents align neatly across the three columns. Measures in the columns are comfortable and rags are controlled. Minor issues: the hero subtext is quite small with slightly tight leading, link underlines read close to default thickness/offset, and the nav labels are a touch light/tracked, reducing clarity.",
        "layout_composition": "Overall structure is clear: a centered hero, followed by a disciplined 3\u2011column grid with identical image tiles (matching aspect ratios and internal mats) and a centered CTA that follows the grid. Gutter spacing between columns is even and the left edges of headings, body, and lists align cleanly. Limitations: column heights end unevenly due to different list lengths, creating a ragged bottom line; the centered hero versus left\u2011anchored name/nav introduces slight perceived width drift; and the CTA sits in a large void with a slightly generous vertical gap that could be tightened for rhythm.",
        "color": "Cohesive palette of muted teal, cream, and beige feels intentional and unifies the illustrations with the chrome. Text uses off\u2011black/gray rather than harsh pure black, and the teal accent is consistently applied to links and the outline CTA, giving clear role signaling. Illustration backgrounds share a controlled warm beige and stay within a narrow value range, keeping the page calm. Minor issues: top\u2011right nav labels appear a bit low\u2011contrast and the beige panels push slightly warm, which risks mild value flicker against the cool white background."
