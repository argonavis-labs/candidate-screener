Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. \n\nThere's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. \n\nThen there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. \n\nThey also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason.

Typography shows a clear hierarchy and readable measures: the hero uses a restrained sans with an italic serif accent on the name, consistent small caps/micro-labels under project cards, and comfortable paragraph line-length/leading. Links appear customized with colored emphasis rather than default blue. However, proof of micro-craft is limited: link underline tuning and states are not visible, captions vary slightly in spacing, and the long collage section mixes label sizes and rags, reducing consistency. Closest anchors: Exemplar 20 (similar editorial tone) and Exemplar 8; this portfolio reads stronger than Ex20 on hierarchy (serif accent, clearer scale) but lacks the rigorous repetition to exceed 3.",
        "layout_composition": "Preflight sloppy cues (3): 1) Several device mocks/screens are too small to read in the hero project tile (+1). 2) Mixed mats with drastic value jumps (periwinkle, lime, pure black) cause rhythm flicker (+1). 3) The 'Designing for Impact' collage shows irregular masonry gutters and ragged bottoms/tops with uneven tile heights (+1). These trigger red_flag 'sloppy_images' and cap Layout \u22642. Beyond that, sections are generally organized (hero \u2192 featured projects \u2192 collage \u2192 about \u2192 footer), but asset handling is inconsistent: one large video tile renders as a black slab, and the collage\u2019s card sizes/spacing don\u2019t align to a stable grid. Closest anchors: Exemplar 20 and Exemplar 8; like Ex20, structure is understandable but asset harmony and grid discipline are weak, so capped at 2.",
        "color": "The warm neutral shell and coral accent have potential, but color control is undermined by strong value/hue flicker: pastel mats (lavender, lime) sit next to a pure black video tile and dark-blue textured backgrounds in the collage, producing uneven contrast and breaking unity. Because the mismatched mats cause value flicker (a noted sloppy cue), Color is capped at 2. Accent usage is otherwise restrained (coral highlights/italics), yet the surrounding imagery isn\u2019t harmonized with tints/borders to unify the page. Closest anchors: Exemplar 20 and Exemplar 8; similar issues with untuned neutrals versus imagery keep this at 2."

But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. ",

It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, \"Hello, I'm Hayley\" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. \n\nThere's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.\n\nUsing an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste.
