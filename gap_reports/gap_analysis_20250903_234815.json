But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. ",

They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.\n\nSo, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The \"See my work\" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. ",

They are going for a left-right, left-right effect, but because the vertical space between the different cards is not the same as the horizontal space, it creates this awkward gap that takes away from the effectiveness of the design. \n\nAt the bottom of the page, you'll also see a section that says \"Like what you see?\" I think this is supposed to fit in the left-right, left-right grid, but because there's no card around it again, it doesn't seem like that. So if they had to either add a card in the background or have that happy its own section. It was a bad choice to put it in the zigzag layout because, really, this is almost like a different concept. All that everything in the zigzag layout is a case study, whereas this is a call to action. So it probably should have been its own layout. ",

Observations: 1) Soft pastel mats (yellow, orange, mint, lavender, coral) help unify varied screenshots. 2) Neutral shell (white background, off\u2011black text) keeps focus on project tiles; shadows are subtle and not harsh. 3) Accent use is restrained within cards; no clashing gradients. Limitations: default-looking link blue in the hero and dark filled buttons feel detached from the pastel system; the coral logo tile is heavier in value than neighboring tiles, creating a slight value spike."

Rough edges: a) Scale jump is extreme (billboard\u2011sized H1 vs very small captions), which flattens intermediate hierarchy. b) Links in the footer appear black with default underlines and no visible state logic. c) No visible tuning of rags/measure; body copy is sparse and on the small side.

Minor issues: a) First two projects use device frames/small screenshots that are not readable, reducing information density. b) Tile heights vary noticeably, creating a slightly uneven vertical rhythm. c) The bottom \u201cMade in Framer\u201d badge adds a small floating element that disrupts the otherwise clean footer edge.",

A bright green project tile has an overlapping laptop mock that breaks the grid and vertical rhythm; 'Case Study' labels appear in different positions across tiles (bottom-left on one, top-right on another), weakening consistency.
