Some of them even don't have a body, whereas others have a body and a title. They also kept the logos of the people that they work with really big, and every logo is a different type. Again, makes it really noisy. ",

Decorative horizontal rules under brand names are inconsistent in spacing. Link styling/states aren\u2019t evident. Overall legible but generic with uneven hierarchy across tiles.",

Several screenshots are tiny/unreadable inside frames (GoodHire/JazzHR, curriculum tile), and inner mats and borders differ between tiles. The big 'OTHER PROJECTS' background type competes with adjacent UI, creating visual noise. Structure feels template\u2011like and inconsistent.",

However, each card introduces different hues and brand colors (purple, greens, teal), leading to a noisy palette without a clear accent system. Neutrals appear untuned and borders/shadows are inconsistent. Color doesn\u2019t unify the varied imagery; it mostly reflects each project\u2019s brand."

But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. ",

Links are consistently teal with underlines across the lists and nav shows a disciplined small\u2011caps/letter\u2011spaced style. Limitations: body size appears on the small side (~12\u201313px) which hurts readability; link underlines look near\u2011default with no visible hover/state cues; minor mixed alignment (centered hero vs left\u2011aligned columns) softens typographic rhythm.",

They do it in some places but not others. \n\nThey use emojis instead of bullet points which creates noise and adds a weird indent on the left. Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. \n\nThere's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. \n\nThen there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. \n\nThey also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason. And then the button outline also doesn't match the stroke width of the text inside the button or frankly anything else on the page. ",

This creates this very awkward and inconsistent right rag.",
