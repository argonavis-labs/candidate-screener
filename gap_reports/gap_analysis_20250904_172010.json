Footer copy uses a lighter grey with adequate contrast and comfortable measure; quotes/ampersands are consistent and rags are clean.

Thumbnails sit on an even baseline with consistent internal mats/shadows, avoiding pixel wobble. Limitation: visual weight varies between photo device mocks and flat graphics causing minor rhythm flicker, and the overall structure is conventional rather than inventive.",

Values are well controlled: tiles pop against neutral chrome; shadows are soft and non\u2011muddy. No harsh #000/#fff pairs or default blues; overall harmony across a wide range of imagery. Limitation: a couple of highly saturated tiles (e.g., magenta/purple poster) momentarily dominate but the neutral frame contains them well."

Some of them even don't have a body, whereas others have a body and a title. They also kept the logos of the people that they work with really big, and every logo is a different type. Again, makes it really noisy. ",

Nav labels (Portfolio/About/Resume) are consistent and the all\u2011caps nameplate has controlled tracking. However, there\u2019s little evidence of a typographic system beyond the hero/nav: project tiles are flattened images so heading/caption styles aren\u2019t demonstrated; link styling/states aren\u2019t visible; scale feels generic with small intro text followed by image-only tiles.

Limitations: image handling shows a few rough edges\u2014the upper\u2011right tile includes a dark strip along the bottom that reads like a mis\u2011cropped internal mat; the giant 'OTHER PROJECTS' tile introduces a heavy typographic block that disrupts the otherwise even row rhythm; overall composition relies on brand-heavy thumbnails instead of a unified site-level system.",

That said, color isn\u2019t unified across the grid: the saturated purple logotype in the center tile dominates, the dark strip at the bottom of the top\u2011right tile creates a value jump, and there\u2019s no clear, consistent accent color in the site chrome to tie pieces together."

But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. ",

Links are customized (teal hue with underlines matching offset/weight) rather than defaults. Body copy sits at a comfortable ~60\u201370ch with steady rags and no widows.

The CTA button sits centered with ample breathing room, and spacing respects a clear system of multiples. Overall structure is simple but controlled with clear hierarchy from hero to columns to CTA. Limitation: only one page view is visible, so multi\u2011section consistency can\u2019t be verified; the centered hero vs left\u2011aligned column content creates a mild alignment shift.",
