They also use a laptop picture for the third image, which is a bit more realistic, but doesn't really work well with their more UI-driven stuff for the first, second, and fourth images. "

Limitation: the yellow tile runs a bit hotter than the others and there is no single accent system for links/states visible, so identity coherence is mostly carried by tile backgrounds rather than a site-wide palette."

However, multiple additional hues (teal link color, greenish tile background, and purple confetti dots) add some noise and soften the sense of a tight accent system.

But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. ",
        "layout_composition": "The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.\n\nSo, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The \"See my work\" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. ",

Device frames contain small, unreadable UI and vary (tablet, laptop, phones), creating inconsistent image treatments. The testimonial cards have uneven text lengths causing ragged bottoms and a wobbly grid.",
