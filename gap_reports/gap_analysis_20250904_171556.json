        "layout_composition": "This is one of the word layouts I've seen. They are going for a left-right, left-right effect, but because the vertical space between the different cards is not the same as the horizontal space, it creates this awkward gap that takes away from the effectiveness of the design. \n\nAt the bottom of the page, you'll also see a section that says \"Like what you see?\" I think this is supposed to fit in the left-right, left-right grid, but because there's no card around it again, it doesn't seem like that. So if they had to either add a card in the background or have that happy its own section. It was a bad choice to put it in the zigzag layout because, really, this is almost like a different concept. All that everything in the zigzag layout is a case study, whereas this is a call to action. So it probably should have been its own layout. ",

However, link styling in the hero appears close to default bright blue with a default underline, not integrated with the palette. Casing is mixed (Title Case like \u201cService Design for Lyft\u201d vs sentence\u2011style elsewhere; \u201cCase Study Coming Soon!\u201d stands out) and there\u2019s minor scale inconsistency between card titles and descriptions.

Limitations: center\u2011aligned hero shifts to a left\u2011weighted content section later (\u201cLike what you see?\u201d) without a clear grid rationale; tile heights vary notably which produces a masonry vibe and irregular baselines; mixed asset types (flat browser screenshots vs an angled phone render) introduce uneven visual weight.",

The shell is neutral (white background, dark text) and shadows are soft, keeping focus on tiles. Constraints: the bright blue inline link in the hero feels off\u2011system next to the pastel accents; varied screenshot colors (strong purples/greens) cause some palette noise; neutrals read closer to pure #000/#fff than tuned greys, so the overall color system feels serviceable rather than refined."

But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. ",

Body copy sits in comfortable short measures with steady 1.4\u20131.6 leading; bullets align neatly and rags are controlled.
