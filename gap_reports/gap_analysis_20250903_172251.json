        "typography": "This is an example of minimalist typography done poorly. Right off the bat, they don't consistently capitalize their sentences. They do it in some places but not others. \n\nThey use emojis instead of bullet points which creates noise and adds a weird indent on the left. Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. \n\nThere's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. \n\nThen there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. \n\nThey also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason. And then the button outline also doesn't match the stroke width of the text inside the button or frankly anything else on the page. ",
        "layout_composition": "The layout is another one of those examples of just different for every section.\n- The navbar is super wide\n- It narrows down into the hero section (which is fine)\n- It broadens a little wider again in the body where there's like case studies\nI think that the hero and the case study section are technically the same width, but because the text on the hero doesn't run all the way to the right, it feels like it's not the same width. This creates this very awkward and inconsistent right rag.",
        "color": "There is sort of like an attempt here at doing sort of like an electric blue driven theme here, but because the case studies are also that backgrounds are sort of completely different colors and then they are very loud.\n\nWe're seeing gradients, we're seeing orange, we're seeing very dark blacks. It just takes away from the overall power of the monochrome plus electric blue color palettes. "

Link styling is consistent (blue inline links in hero and nav) and the pill \"VIEW\" buttons use a uniform outline weight. Rags are controlled with no widows/orphans visible. Limitation: the link blue feels default and a bit hot, and states/underline tuning aren\u2019t clearly visible.",
        "layout_composition": "Two-column case study list shows a steady rhythm: identical image mats on the left with text blocks aligned on a shared left edge; even vertical spacing between rows; clear section breaks via centered section labels (CASE STUDIES / ADDITIONAL WORK). The additional work grid shifts to a tidy two-up layout with aligned titles, metadata, and consistently placed outline buttons. Footer provides a decisive full-bleed break and closes the page cleanly. Limitation: centered section labels feel slightly disconnected from left-aligned content, and varied tile aspect ratios (e.g., black logo tile vs pastel device shots) introduce minor rhythm flicker.",
        "color": "A single strong blue accent unifies nav, inline links, and the full-bleed footer; cards use soft mats (light blues, beige) that generally stay harmonious. Contrast is good (white on saturated blue in footer; dark text on white body). However, the accent blue reads close to default and somewhat hot; neutrals appear more pure black/white than tuned; and the mixed tile backgrounds (black, purple gradient, tan) create mild flicker rather than a fully unified palette."

It probably is not the most important thing on this page. And also it's in awkward all caps and a font that doesn't look very good all capped. \n\nAnd then the images - all the text is different sizes and different. Some of them even don't have a body, whereas others have a body and a title. They also kept the logos of the people that they work with really big, and every logo is a different type. Again, makes it really noisy. ",

        "color": "There are too many colors going on here, it's kind of a disaster.\n- There's an attempt at doing a pastel color background for all the images, but because there's so many colors in the UI in the foreground, it effectively loses the effect.\n- They also kept all the logos of the clients they work with really big, and because all the logos have different colors too, it just totally takes away from the intended effect of the pastel palette.\n- There's also some really awkward examples of color usage at the very bottom of the page where they've used full-color social logos (which is already a lot) and on top of it, they've chosen to use a colored outline in teal, which is like tons of color that doesn't mean anything and in a place where it's probably not very important to draw attention to.

There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. ",
