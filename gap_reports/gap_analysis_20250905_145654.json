But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. ",
        "layout_composition": "The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.\n\nSo, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The \"See my work\" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. ",

Reconstruction: Type Scale appears deliberate: Display serif (H1), small intro meta (\u224812\u201313px, 1.6\u20131.8 lh), section labels in small\u2011caps with tracked letters (~0.08\u20130.1em), body text set to readable measure (~55\u201365ch) with 1.5\u20131.6 line height; hierarchy is multi\u2011modal (size + weight + casing). Baseline rhythm feels even between headline, icon cards, and lists. Micro\u2011craft signals: tuned serif/sans pairing with distinct tones; small\u2011caps labels with controlled tracking; consistent bullet/indent rhythm across the three lists; link underlines and color appear custom (teal, underline thickness/offset matching the text weight). Link/State Audit: Links in the lists use the same teal color and underlines; primary CTA uses sentence\u2011case sans with clear affordance; no hover states visible but roles are consistent. Consistency Map: 1) Same serif/sans pairing across [hero], [grid], [cta]; 2) Small\u2011caps section labels repeat across all three columns; 3) Uniform list typography and spacing per column; 4) Nav uses the same sans family and tone. Failure Theme: limited breadth\u2014only one view; no proof of complex text systems (tables, captions, visited states). Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 3 (Agni). anchor_deltas: [our page uses a more editorial serif display than Ex3, our evidence is a single view vs multi\u2011section in Ex3, fewer UI states shown, less long\u2011form reading, stronger small\u2011caps labeling rhythm].

Reconstruction: Grid appears 12\u2011column with a 3\u2011up card layout; gutters are even, vertical rhythm is consistent (similar spacing above/below cards and between label/body lists); illustrations share identical container sizes and align to the same baselines; scan path is clear from hero to 3\u2011up to CTA. Micro\u2011craft signals: matched illustration frames and padding; stable column widths and equal gutters; consistent spacing increments (likely multiples of 8); button width/padding matches the typographic scale and is visually centered; no ragged bottoms or cutoffs. Link/State Audit: CTA is primary with bordered style; list links remain inline\u2014clear hierarchy of interactive elements. Consistency Map: 1) Repeated card structure across the three columns; 2) Identical image mats and radii; 3) Repeated spacing rhythm between sections; 4) Navigation spacing consistent with the overall grid. Failure Theme: Only one viewport\u2014no responsive or deeper page patterns; no complex imagery presentation (e.g., device mocks) to stress the system. Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 4 (Sally) / Exemplar 3 (Agni). anchor_deltas: [our layout is more minimal and editorial, fewer project tiles/screens, less responsive variety shown, simpler component palette].

Reconstruction: Palette = warm neutral base + deep green brand + teal accent; accents are applied sparingly (links, icons, button) with strong value control; neutrals are slightly warm (not pure #fff) which reduces contrast harshness. Micro\u2011craft signals: hue\u2011shifted neutrals, unified teal across links/illustrations/button, illustration mats chosen to balance the green and avoid value flicker, no stray blues or off\u2011brand colors, consistent border weight/color on CTA. Link/State Audit: Interactive links share the same teal color and underline; primary action uses accent via stroke+label; no hover states shown but roles are coherent. Consistency Map: 1) Teal accent repeated across [nav], [grid lists], [cta]; 2) Beige mats unify the three illustrations; 3) Deep green only in logotype to anchor brand; 4) Background neutral consistent throughout.

Link/State Audit: CTAs alternate between a black pill button and text links with arrow glyphs (\"Case Study \u2192\", \"Contact Us \u2192\"); no visible hover/visited differentiation. Consistency Map: repeated display face across [hero]/[section headers]; pill CTA style in [hero]/[cta]/[footer]; arrow link treatment in [work grid]/[footer]; consistent sentence\u2011case labeling in [testimonials]/[footer]. Failure Theme: hierarchy relies mostly on size/weight; meta text contrast occasionally low (light grey in [testimonials]); no evident link state system beyond color/arrow; marketing copy headings verge on shouty, compressing nuance. Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 7. Deltas vs anchor\u2014(1) cleaner rags and more stable line lengths here, (2) but more boilerplate headline style, (3) less evident state styling for links, (4) testimonial body contrast lower, (5) fewer refined micro details like tuned underline offsets. Score Justification: Reads competent with consistent family and adequate scale discipline, but limited state logic and marketing-default hierarchy keep it at baseline.

Reconstruction: Grid appears single centered column with section paddings ~96\u2013120px; cards use even corner radii; gutters largely consistent; however device mocks are presented at scales where UI is unreadable and mix white cards with a saturated green slab causing rhythm/value breaks. Link/State Audit: CTA placement/layout consistent (centered pills or right\u2011aligned text links), but no progressive disclosure beyond section jumps. Consistency Map: repeated hero/CTA pattern at top and near end; case\u2011study tiles all use device frames; testimonial cards maintain same avatar + quote structure.

Link/State Audit: Links appear blue with an arrow; CTA pills are black; no visible hover/active/visited states, and color roles are inconsistent across CTAs vs links. Consistency Map: navy body/headline color repeated in [hero]/[section headers]; black pill CTA repeated in [hero]/[cta]; blue text links with arrows repeated in [work grid]/[footer].

[projects] Card titles in sentence case with small meta lines and a consistent 'Read more \u2192' link treatment.

Reconstruction: Scale appears to follow 3\u20134 steps (XL display \u2192 H2 section heads \u2192 card/quote titles \u2192 body/meta). Leading ~1.4\u20131.5 for body keeps paragraphs readable; measures sit around 60\u201375ch. Hierarchy is multi\u2011modal (size + weight + accent mark), not just bold. Consistency: Section heads carry the same tone, marker highlight is applied consistently to key nouns, and CTA microcopy reuses the arrow mark. Body and meta casing are consistent; link tone is uniform across sections. Micro\u2011craft: Baselines between headings and copy are steady; rags on paragraph blocks are clean; list/CTA punctuation spacing looks even; underline/arrow offset aligned to baseline. Link/State Audit: CTAs use arrow affordance and pill/border styling; visited/hover states are not demonstrated. Consistency Map: 1) Yellow marker accent on key words [hero, testimonials]. 2) Sentence\u2011case titles with lighter meta [projects, testimonials]. 3) Arrow\u2011forward CTAs [projects, footer].

Reconstruction: Single container width with a vertical rhythm that feels like an 8/16 system; section headers create scannable anchors; cards maintain equal paddings and matched radii; testimonials grid preserves alignment and gutters. Image presentation is neat (custom mats and device shadows), but device screens are shown at perspective/size where UI is largely unreadable. Link/State Audit: CTAs consistently placed at the lower-left of cards; navigation remains stable in the header; no hover/state proof for cards.

I see a small size. I see three sizes. I also see two different weights. I see italics too. And then there's a color change in the typography too.

Reconstruction: Type scale shows at least four levels\u2014hero body (~18\u201320px) with ~1.5\u20131.6 line-height, company names one step heavier than role, small meta/date in lighter tone/italic, and micro labels for buttons. Hierarchy uses size + weight + tone (not bold-only). Readability: wide but controlled measure (~65\u201375ch) and comfortable paragraph spacing; rags are clean with minimal hyphenation. Consistency: identical treatment for each role block (company/role/date/description/CTA), repeatable italic date style, consistent button label casing. Micro-craft: optical alignment between left and right columns; paragraph rhythm keeps equal top/bottom spacing; quotes/apostrophes look typographically correct; underline is suppressed in buttons while inline link color differentiates the email. Link/State Audit: interactive elements use a consistent pill-outline button style for \"View work\" and a single accent color for inline links; nav items visually indicate link affordance via tone/weight. Consistency Map: repeated italic date style [experience_list], uniform pill-outline CTAs [experience_list], consistent company-title stack [experience_list], and matching nav/link tone [nav, footer]. Failure Theme: limited variety in heading levels\u2014no distinct section headings\u2014and the typographic voice is restrained, edging toward generic editorial. Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 1 (Charlie Deets) \u2014 both are editorial resumes. anchor_deltas: less robust heading scale; fewer link/state examples; narrower type system (no quotes, lists, or captions).

Image presentation is text-only, avoiding device mock clutter; scannability is strong with left-column anchors and right-column narratives. Link/State Audit: CTAs positioned consistently at the end of each block; nav affords clear path to other sections (Product design, Illustration, About). Consistency Map: repeated left/right layout for all roles, uniform CTA placement, consistent block spacing, and equal outer margins across sections.

Consistency Map: (1) client meta badge style, (2) title weight/size pair, (3) quiet body copy, repeated across [grid]/[project blocks]/[footer]. Failure Theme: slightly generic hierarchy at times and limited typographic voice; the hero H1 reads a bit heavy and the \u201cSee all work\u201d link lacks a visible hover/state proof. Anchor Comparison: closest anchors = Exemplar 4 and 8. Deltas: stronger small\u2011caps/meta discipline than Ex4, more tuned display size/measure than Ex4, however less expressive editorial voice and fewer state proofs than Ex8. Score Justification: Clear multi\u2011modal hierarchy, consistent scale, and readable copy across multiple sections merits a 4. Preflight: sloppy_count: 2 (some thumbnail UI unreadable in [selected work] montage; stacked browser windows in \u201cRisk Profiles\u201d small text), template_count: 1 (\"I'm [Name]\" hero).

Reconstruction: Grid uses a fixed central column with generous margins; vertical spacing appears in consistent increments; images are well\u2011sized focal points followed by a repeatable caption system. Image presentation: clean mats, matched soft shadows and radii, consistent device angles; crops feel intentional and non\u2011cutoff. Scan path is clear: image first, then title/meta/description. Link/State Audit: navigation affords clear routes; section link \u201cSee all work\u201d aligned to the right creates a secondary affordance. Consistency Map: (1) image\u2011then\u2011caption block, (2) left\u2011aligned caption stack with even gutters, (3) consistent device render style across desktop/mobile. Failure Theme: mild template feel (centered hero and repeating single\u2011column work blocks) and a couple of smaller UI renders remain too zoomed out. Anchor Comparison: closest anchor = Exemplar 4.

Reconstruction: Palette centers on tuned neutrals with a controlled navy accent for headings and sparse coral for CTA; shadows are soft and hue\u2011shifted rather than black; device renders sit on light tint backgrounds to avoid value flicker. Unification & State Logic: links use subtle color changes; client labels use desaturated blue consistently; charts and UI accents harmonize with the shell.

Reconstruction: Single-column flow with even outer paddings; however, image presentation is weak\u2014both tiles contain tiny, unreadable UI (phone mock and complex dashboard) and use different background mats (dark navy vs light blue), breaking rhythm. Gaps between tiles are regular but the gallery feels like isolated billboards rather than a coherent grid. Link/State Audit: navigation links and text links present but no visible interaction states. Consistency Map: repeated full-bleed project tiles; centered copy; uniform outer margins. Failure Theme: device-mock collage with unreadable UI, and mismatched mats causing value flicker; limited structure beyond a single column.

Captions are quite small and low-contrast in places, risking accessibility on white. Baseline rhythm looks steady across hero and grid.
