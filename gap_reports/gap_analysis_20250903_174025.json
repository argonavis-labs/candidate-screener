        "typography": "This is an example of minimalist typography done poorly. Right off the bat, they don't consistently capitalize their sentences. They do it in some places but not others. \n\nThey use emojis instead of bullet points which creates noise and adds a weird indent on the left. Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. \n\nThere's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. \n\nThen there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. \n\nThey also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason. And then the button outline also doesn't match the stroke width of the text inside the button or frankly anything else on the page. ",
        "layout_composition": "The layout is another one of those examples of just different for every section.\n- The navbar is super wide\n- It narrows down into the hero section (which is fine)\n- It broadens a little wider again in the body where there's like case studies\nI think that the hero and the case study section are technically the same width, but because the text on the hero doesn't run all the way to the right, it feels like it's not the same width. This creates this very awkward and inconsistent right rag.",
        "color": "There is sort of like an attempt here at doing sort of like an electric blue driven theme here, but because the case studies are also that backgrounds are sort of completely different colors and then they are very loud.\n\nWe're seeing gradients, we're seeing orange, we're seeing very dark blacks. It just takes away from the overall power of the monochrome plus electric blue color palettes. "

Limitation: patterns are conventional and some CTAs feel a bit floaty; the left column\u2019s image values vary (e.g., black tile vs pastel tiles) creating minor rhythm flicker.",

Observations: 1) A single vivid cobalt accent is used for links and a large footer band, providing a clear system. 2) Neutral shell stays white with dark text; small grey metadata provides hierarchy. 3) Project thumbnails use varied pastel mats (light blue, lavender, peach) that are mostly harmonious. Limitation: the accent blue is quite hot and the saturated footer is heavy relative to the otherwise light page; the black Adobe tile introduces a strong value jump that adds flicker."

        "typography": "They used a pretty interesting serif here that I think is a sign that they have thought about this. The body also uses a relatively interesting looking model. But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. ",
        "layout_composition": "The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality. They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.\n\nSo, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The \"See my work\" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. ",

Limitation: link underlines appear close to browser defaults (thickness/offset) and the italic serif wordmark in the header introduces a secondary voice that slightly clashes with the hero serif.",

Limitation: the centered hero combined with a left\u2011anchored logo creates a mild alignment tension, and the isolated CTA feels slightly floaty relative to the three columns.",
        "color": "Harmonious palette with tuned neutrals and a single accent. Observations: 1) Warm off\u2011white background avoids harsh #fff; text appears off\u2011black for comfortable contrast. 2) Teal accent is applied consistently to links, bullets, icon strokes, and the CTA border. 3) Beige illustration mats unify the three tiles and keep saturation controlled. 4) No clashing hues; accents are sparingly used to guide interaction. Limitation: reliance on one accent hue makes states/roles less explicit, and the teal on cream could edge toward low contrast for smaller text in some contexts."

The title/label block aligns to a shared left inset across tiles, which keeps the set cohesive.
