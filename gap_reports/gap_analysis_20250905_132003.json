But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. ",

They also randomly shift from center-aligned to left-aligned.\n\nSo, if you look at the nav bar, it's kinda full-width. The header is quite narrow, and then the body is wide again. The \"See my work\" CTA is also super narrow, so it's kind of a little ragged and random. ",

Reconstruction: Type Scale shows display H1 (~64\u201372) serif, section labels (~14\u201316) uppercase sans with tracked letters, body copy (~14\u201316) sans with ~1.5 leading and comfortable 55\u201365ch measure in each column; hierarchy is multi\u2011modal (size + weight + casing). Baseline rhythm appears stable across the three tiles and lists. Link/State Audit: links are teal with consistent underlines that match color and offset across bullet lists and body; CTA uses bordered style with text role instead of filled button, aligning with quiet typographic voice. Consistency Map: repeated serif/sans pairing across [logo],[hero]; repeated uppercase micro\u2011labels in [nav] and [hero-columns]; identical link treatment across bulleted links in each column; punctuation and bullets align neatly.

Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 3 (Agni) \u2014 similar editorial pairing and disciplined hierarchy. Deltas: fewer sections to validate scale; heavier reliance on one hero; more characterful serif than the anchor producing stronger headline presence. Score Justification: Clear, well\u2011paced hierarchy and consistent link/label system with multiple micro\u2011craft signals warrant a 4 given Single\u2011view Pass conditions and absence of red flags.

Image presentation is tidy\u2014illustrations use unified beige mats and consistent stroke weights. Link/State Audit: CTA alignment and list links offer a predictable path\u2014scan columns, then CTA. Consistency Map: repeated tile sizing across [hero-columns]; consistent gutter between tiles and between tile/copy; left-edge alignment mirrored from [hero-columns] to [CTA] and [nav]; spacing scale remains consistent (no ragged gutters). Failure Theme: breadth\u2014only the hero is visible; no project detail layouts to test responsiveness or complex composition. Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 3 \u2014 comparable editorial grid discipline. Deltas: this page uses a centered hero rather than multi-card case study grid; stronger symmetry; fewer modules shown to verify system breadth.

Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 3; anchor_deltas: weaker caption/meta consistency, less rigorous link/underline treatment, occasional long first\u2011paragraph measure, slightly lower micro\u2011craft polish than anchor.

It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, \"Hello, I'm Hayley\" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. \n\nThere's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.\n\nUsing an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste.

This creates a lot of white space towards the right side. Work and about are top-aligned, but then the social icons are center-aligned. This inconsistency creates some ugly white space. ",

Reconstruction: Page uses a single central container (~1100\u20131200px) with even vertical spacing; grid alternates 1\u20132 columns for case studies. Image presentation is the weak point: multiple device frames show tiny, unreadable UI; mats vary (white card, saturated green panel, light blue panel), and devices carry heavy shadows.

Reconstruction: Type Scale appears deliberate\u2014oversized section titles (~64\u201396) contrasted with compact meta/body (~12\u201314) and utility text; consistent left alignment and generous leading (~1.4\u20131.6). Hierarchy uses both size and weight plus tone (meta in lighter tone vs titles in heavy grotesk). Readability: measures are short and clear with ample whitespace; titles break cleanly (e.g., \u201cWebflow Dot Com\u201d wraps without awkward hyphenation). Consistency: headings maintain the same casing/weight across sections; meta rows above each grid keep consistent spacing and punctuation; nav/utility type matches the system. Micro-craft: careful tracking on large titles, stable baselines, tidy bullet separators in meta rows, and tight punctuation on the sticky note. Link/State Audit: top-right nav retains a subtle emphasis state; S/M/L control shows an active dot\u2014states are minimal but consistent. Consistency Map: repeated left-aligned mega-headlines, uniform meta-row style, consistent grid captions/labels, identical nav type. Failure Theme: limited text diversity inside tiles means fewer proofs of paragraph/body tuning. Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 8. anchor_deltas: larger and more expressive display scale than the anchor; fewer in-tile text blocks to prove paragraph rhythm; slightly bolder tone in headings. Score Justification: Strong editorial minimal typography across multiple sections with consistent hierarchy and rhythm; minor evidence gaps on long-form copy keep it at 4.

Reconstruction: Grid/Spacing show a disciplined system\u2014consistent container width, even vertical spacing between sections, and reliable column rhythm inside each gallery; scanning path is clear: meta row \u2192 grid thumbnails. Image presentation: thumbnails share equal mats and size per row; device/brand comps are cleanly cropped without jaggies; no irregular masonry gutters. Link/State Audit: section chips (S/M/L) repeat consistently; nav targets are sparse and clear. Consistency Map: repeated section intro bar, same grid density across sections, consistent rule dividers, identical thumbnail padding and spacing. Failure Theme: some tiles mix dark and light artwork which can read as value flicker; limited breakpoint evidence. Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 8. anchor_deltas: more dramatic hero minimalism; tighter, more uniform gutters across long page; slightly higher density of tiles per section than the anchor. Score Justification: Clear, confident editorial structure and very consistent gallery presentation across many sections; minor value flicker in imagery noted but not structural.

        "color": "Observations: [hero] neutral white shell with a single vivid orange sticky-note accent; [grid] diverse project thumbnails with saturated gradients next to grayscale comps; [footer] quiet neutrals. Reconstruction: Shell relies on monochrome (black/white) with a rare accent; no heavy shadows; borders/dividers are subtle gray. Unification & State Logic: states are indicated via tone (active dot in S/M/L), not color-heavy CTAs; however, thumbnails lack unified mats which introduces value swings between dark and light tiles. Link/State Audit: minimal use of accent color; navigation/state changes rely on weight/position more than hue. Consistency Map: persistent neutral shell, consistent gray divider rules, accent restrained to hero and small UI controls. Failure Theme: value flicker from mixed thumbnail backgrounds; absence of unifying mats/border tints around tiles. Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 8. anchor_deltas: less use of tinted mats to harmonize imagery; stronger single accent in hero; slightly harsher contrast when dark tiles abut white background. Score Justification: Color decisions are disciplined and restrained but gallery integration could be more unified; hence mid\u2011high score.

Reconstruction: Type Scale shows a disciplined editorial system (display-sized body intro, section labels in smaller sans/meta, body text readable with ~1.5 line-height). Hierarchy uses size + weight + tint (not only bold). Baseline rhythm is steady across sections with matching line-heights; rags are controlled (no widows). Link/State Audit: links appear as understated text with a thin arrow glyph; same treatment across [notes], [posts], [photos], avoiding default-blue and maintaining contrast. Consistency Map: repeated section labels in the left rail; identical date/meta styling; consistent 'View all \u2026 \u2192' micro\u2011pattern; same body font/leading across all sections. Failure Theme: editorial system is strong but we don\u2019t see interactive states (hover/visited) and there\u2019s limited variety in headings/quotes.

Reconstruction: Grid appears to be a fixed content column with a narrow metadata rail; gutters look like 24\u201332px multiples; vertical rhythm between sections is consistent; elements align to the same vertical edges creating a clean scan path. Image presentation is neat (no mismatched radii, no device mock clutter). Link/State Audit: navigational affordances are subtle but consistent via text links with arrows; section transitions are clear through spacing rather than heavy rules. Consistency Map: repeated left-rail labeling; uniform row structure for lists; consistent image aspect/crops and equal guttering; same column width across sections. Failure Theme: minimalism limits demonstration of complex responsive states or multi-density image handling (we only see one breakpoint). Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 5. anchor_deltas: candidate adds a left metadata rail (more editorial), shows more photography blocks, and fewer componentized cards than anchor.

Reconstruction: Palette is essentially a disciplined neutral stack\u2014black body, two grays for meta and labels\u2014with a single accent motif (arrow glyphs) rather than chromatic CTAs. Neutrals feel calibrated rather than #000/#fff harshness. Link/State Audit: links appear as text with an arrow; state changes (hover/visited) are not evidenced here. Consistency Map: same gray tint for dates across [notes] and [posts]; left-rail labels share a unified gray; all images sit on clean white with no mismatched mats; accent arrow appears consistently. Failure Theme: color system is intentionally sparse; absence of explicit interactive state colors or broader palette roles keeps it from a 4+. Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 5. anchor_deltas: candidate uses slightly warmer grays; relies on photographic color more than accent hues; fewer distinct states displayed.
