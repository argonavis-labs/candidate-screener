They do it in some places but not others. \n\nThey use emojis instead of bullet points which creates noise and adds a weird indent on the left. Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. \n\nThere's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. \n\nThen there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. \n\nThey also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason. And then the button outline also doesn't match the stroke width of the text inside the button or frankly anything else on the page. ",

It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, \"Hello, I'm Hayley\" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. \n\nThere's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.\n\nUsing an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste.

From Hey Natalia to Bridging the Gap to Product Designer, all of these are bold. When everything is bold, nothing is bold. \n\nIf you look at the navbar, you see that there's a classic example of super-wide letter space, all-caps design in the word Product Designer. This is another classic rookie mistake in typesetting. \n\nAnother example of a rookie mistake is if you go to her project section. There is a pattern where she uses a vertical divider line between every label for the case studies that she did, but the vertical line is way taller and also very dark, which instead makes the vertical line seem like it grabs too much attention. This is a common pattern of failure. \n\nAnother bad pattern here is if you look at the bottom where in her About Me section she has tons of random bolding in her paragraph text. It's like almost feels like every fifth word here is bolded. And then if you look at the bulleted list inside the body of the text, the bulleted list has too much left-side indent. \n\nAnd then she randomly switches from left-align text to center-align text when it comes to her email.

But then when you go into the \"My skills\" and \"About me\" section, it's really terrible, right? So if you look at the indent right after the title. There's a huge amount of white space. We're thinking that the things under the title start a little bit more to the right for no reason. It doesn't align with anything. And then there's this really strange triangular text pattern that serves no purpose In the skill section.",

        "typography": "Observations: Hero uses a large bold sans for the headline with a shorter subhead; project rows repeat a small uppercase/meta line above titles and an outline 'Read more' CTA; about section shows four mini-columns with small headings and body. Reconstruction (Type Scale): single-family geometric/grotesk (Inter-like) with roughly 4 levels (H1, H2 project titles, small meta, body). Readability is generally fine but some meta/body text appears undersized and light in contrast in project rows; capitalization varies ('Data Management infrastructure' vs 'Text to Speech mobile app'). Micro-craft: baseline rhythm is passable but not tuned; CTA labels vary in casing; no custom underline/hover treatments visible; punctuation/spacing is standard. Link/State Audit: links/CTAs rely on outline buttons; no visible hover/active differentiation; nav links appear default. Consistency Map: same family across sections; repeated meta\u2192title\u2192CTA block; consistent letterspacing for small caps; accent color reused for small labels. Failure Theme: hierarchy leans on size alone with thin secondary levels; minor casing/contrast inconsistencies. Anchor Comparison: closest to Exemplar 4; anchor_deltas: less typographic nuance, smaller/low-contrast meta text, generic outline-CTA styling.

Reconstruction (Grid/Spacing): consistent centered container with comfortable vertical rhythm; safe 2-col composition reused; screenshots are often small within window frames, limiting readability; device mock trio uses heavy drop-shadow on dark mat. Image presentation is mostly clean but some frames feel slightly cropped/tight. Link/State Audit: outline buttons placed consistently under summaries; nav is simple with left logo/right links. Consistency Map: repeated left-text/right-mock modules, alternating mats, same container width, consistent CTA placement. Failure Theme: heavy template repetition and limited art-direction variety; screenshots too small to read which weakens hierarchy of evidence.

Preflight: sloppy_count: 0, template_count: 0. Reconstruction \u2014 Type Scale: At least three levels are visible (name/section labels, item titles, body). Hierarchy mixes size, weight and tone (italic for tagline, lighter small caps\u2011like section heads). Readability: body measure ~60\u201370ch with ~1.5\u20131.6 leading; generous margins; no widows/orphans apparent. Consistency: link style appears as subtle tinted text with a \u2197 external cue; section headings keep the same tone and spacing. Micro\u2011craft: even baseline rhythm, en/em\u2011dash usage and proper apostrophes; tidy punctuation spacing; clean list alignment. Link/State Audit: links are consistently tinted and paired with an external\u2011link arrow symbol; no conflicting underline thickness across sections observed. Consistency Map: repeated small section labels, consistent link tint + \u2197 glyph, uniform paragraph spacing and grid left\u2011edge alignment across hero, grid and article sections. Failure Theme: limited scale contrast and few heading levels; overall typographic system feels intentionally quiet but not deeply expressive. Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 5; anchor_deltas: less size contrast than Exemplar 5, fewer heading levels, lighter link affordance (subtler than Exemplar 5).
