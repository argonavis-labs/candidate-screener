Some of them even don't have a body, whereas others have a body and a title. They also kept the logos of the people that they work with really big, and every logo is a different type. Again, makes it really noisy. ",

No clear evidence of tuned link styles, baseline rhythm, or micro\u2011details.",

They do it in some places but not others. \n\nThey use emojis instead of bullet points which creates noise and adds a weird indent on the left. Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. \n\nThere's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. \n\nThen there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. \n\nThey also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason. And then the button outline also doesn't match the stroke width of the text inside the button or frankly anything else on the page. ",
        "layout_composition": "The layout is another one of those examples of just different for every section.\n- The navbar is super wide\n- It narrows down into the hero section (which is fine)\n- It broadens a little wider again in the body where there's like case studies\nI think that the hero and the case study section are technically the same width, but because the text on the hero doesn't run all the way to the right, it feels like it's not the same width. This creates this very awkward and inconsistent right rag.",
        "color": "There is sort of like an attempt here at doing sort of like an electric blue driven theme here, but because the case studies are also that backgrounds are sort of completely different colors and then they are very loud.\n\nWe're seeing gradients, we're seeing orange, we're seeing very dark blacks. It just takes away from the overall power of the monochrome plus electric blue color palettes. "

Inline links use a bright, default\u2011ish blue with simple underlines; little evidence of tuned underline weight/offset or state logic. The hero paragraph runs very long (\u224890\u2013100ch), diluting rhythm and making the opening block feel heavy.

Case studies follow a consistent left\u2011image/right\u2011copy pattern with steady gutters and vertical rhythm; images are well\u2011matted, sharp, and readable. The 'Additional Work' section maintains a tidy two\u2011column card grid with aligned captions and consistent button placement. Section labels (CASE STUDIES / ADDITIONAL WORK) create clear structure, and the full\u2011bleed footer provides a decisive close without disturbing the main container widths. Minor conventionality, but execution is controlled and cohesive.",

Neutrals are clean and support readability; varied pastel/soft mats behind thumbnails help unify mixed imagery without clashing.

There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason.

Body copy appears within a comfortable measure with adequate leading; links use a customized teal with an underline that matches the aesthetic rather than a default blue.
