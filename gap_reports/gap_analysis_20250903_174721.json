Some of them even don't have a body, whereas others have a body and a title. They also kept the logos of the people that they work with really big, and every logo is a different type. Again, makes it really noisy. ",

Rough edges: a dark strip under the right tile in the first row reads like a misaligned footer/border; the billboard \u2018OTHER PROJECTS\u2019 panel dominates and crops letterforms awkwardly, upsetting rhythm; screenshots vary in scale/readability and some elements crowd edges (phone mock close to right edge).

But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. ",
        "layout_composition": "The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality.

Comfortable measures and leading in the intro and three columns (~50\u201365ch; ~1.4\u20131.6 leading) keep paragraphs readable. Section labels (UNDERSTAND / ITERATE / REFINE) are consistently styled in small all\u2011caps with measured tracking, giving a steady hierarchy. Links are consistently treated in teal with underlines across lists, and bullet/indent rhythm is even. Limitation: body size is on the small side and link underlines look close to default thickness/offset, so micro\u2011craft isn\u2019t fully demonstrated.",

The illustration tiles are equal squares with matching mats and consistent gutters, and the column headings and copy align neatly under each tile. Header balance (name left, nav right) is tidy; vertical rhythm between hero, tiles, and lists feels measured. CTA button at the bottom keeps the flow simple. Limitation: only one view is provided and the centered outline CTA reads a bit floaty/generic; column bottoms become uneven due to differing list lengths.",

Warm beige illustration panels harmonize with an off\u2011white page background and near\u2011black text, giving good value control. Color roles are clear and restrained, avoiding clashes despite illustrated tiles. Limitation: body text gray is slightly light and link/CTA teal is fairly saturated with no visible state variations shown in this view."

Limitations: per-tile saturated backgrounds create noticeable value jumps across the page and there\u2019s no clear, consistent link/CTA color system beyond a neutral outline button; overall chroma feels more illustration-led than system-led."

I see a small size. I see three sizes. I also see two different weights. I see italics too. And then there's a color change in the typography too.
