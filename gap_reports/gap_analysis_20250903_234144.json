        "typography": "This is an example of minimalist typography done poorly. Right off the bat, they don't consistently capitalize their sentences. They do it in some places but not others. \n\nThey use emojis instead of bullet points which creates noise and adds a weird indent on the left. Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. \n\nThere's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. \n\nThen there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. \n\nThey also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason. And then the button outline also doesn't match the stroke width of the text inside the button or frankly anything else on the page. ",
        "layout_composition": "The layout is another one of those examples of just different for every section.\n- The navbar is super wide\n- It narrows down into the hero section (which is fine)\n- It broadens a little wider again in the body where there's like case studies\nI think that the hero and the case study section are technically the same width, but because the text on the hero doesn't run all the way to the right, it feels like it's not the same width. This creates this very awkward and inconsistent right rag.",
        "color": "There is sort of like an attempt here at doing sort of like an electric blue driven theme here, but because the case studies are also that backgrounds are sort of completely different colors and then they are very loud.\n\nWe're seeing gradients, we're seeing orange, we're seeing very dark blacks. It just takes away from the overall power of the monochrome plus electric blue color palettes. "

Limitations: the link styling feels defaultish (no visible custom underline/hover); casing mixes all\u2011lowercase in the hero/nav with Title Case headings, which weakens system cohesion; decorative emoji in hero/footer adds a casual tone that slightly reduces polish.",

Observations: 1) Case\u2011study rows use a consistent pattern (image left, text right) with matching aspect\u2011ratio thumbnails and uniform corner radii; gutters and image/text offsets look even. 2) The 'Additional Work' section maintains two equal columns with regular vertical rhythm; captions and VIEW CTAs align to the same grid. 3) Section labels ('CASE STUDIES', 'ADDITIONAL WORK') provide clear section breaks without width drift\u2014containers feel consistent from hero through grid. Limitation: the very bold full\u2011width blue footer breaks the otherwise calm rhythm, and some tile heights in the two\u2011column area differ slightly, introducing minor vertical rhythm flicker.",
        "color": "Palette is serviceable with a single strong accent and calm neutrals. Observations: 1) Bright cobalt is used consistently for links and as the dominant footer color. 2) Thumbnail mats employ soft pastels (light blue, peach) plus a dark navy, generally controlled in value so text remains primary. 3) Neutral shell (white background, dark text, grey meta) supports readability. Limitation: the accent blue is very saturated and the solid blue footer creates a sharp value jump; mixed mat hues across tiles aren\u2019t fully harmonized, causing mild color flicker."

Small control badges ('M/L') and metadata blocks are aligned to the grid, showing attention to systemization. Limitations: the oversized headings occasionally create visual imbalance and a forced wrap ('Webflow Dot Com'); the hero sticky\u2011note vignette feels stylistically separate and slightly heavy in value; a few last rows end ragged due to uneven tile counts.",

But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. ",
