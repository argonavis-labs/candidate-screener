        "typography": "This is an example of minimalist typography done poorly. Right off the bat, they don't consistently capitalize their sentences. They do it in some places but not others. \n\nThey use emojis instead of bullet points which creates noise and adds a weird indent on the left. Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. \n\nThere's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. \n\nThen there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. \n\nThey also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason. And then the button outline also doesn't match the stroke width of the text inside the button or frankly anything else on the page. ",
        "layout_composition": "The layout is another one of those examples of just different for every section.\n- The navbar is super wide\n- It narrows down into the hero section (which is fine)\n- It broadens a little wider again in the body where there's like case studies\nI think that the hero and the case study section are technically the same width, but because the text on the hero doesn't run all the way to the right, it feels like it's not the same width. This creates this very awkward and inconsistent right rag.",
        "color": "There is sort of like an attempt here at doing sort of like an electric blue driven theme here, but because the case studies are also that backgrounds are sort of completely different colors and then they are very loud.\n\nWe're seeing gradients, we're seeing orange, we're seeing very dark blacks. It just takes away from the overall power of the monochrome plus electric blue color palettes. "

Image presentation is tidy\u2014no cut\u2011offs or jaggy shadows\u2014though a couple of device mocks are a bit small to read.

Consistency Map: repeated project module; identical spacing stacks (label/title/summary/CTA); consistent image mat sizing; same CTA placement across rows.

Reconstruction: Type Scale shows large paragraph display in hero (approx 20\u201322px) followed by smaller body/captions (~12\u201314px). Hierarchy relies mostly on size and italics rather than multi-level headings; captions feel under-sized which reduces scanning. Readability: hero measure is on the longer side but within tolerance; captions verge on too small. Consistency: serif used across hero and captions; left-aligned rag is consistent; link styling not clearly differentiated. Micro\u2011craft: rags are mostly clean; no visible tuning of link underlines/offsets; no proof of number/punctuation care. Link/State Audit: links/CTAs are not distinct (no clear color state or underline rhythm across [hero], [footer]).

Micro-craft: clean punctuation spacing, consistent sentence casing, balanced paragraph rags, and even spacing between heading stacks and CTAs. Link/State Audit: links appear as neutral-outline pills for \u201cView work\u201d and a warm accent for the email; nav links share tone with body\u2014subtle but consistent. Consistency Map: (1) italicized date meta across entries, (2) recurring outline pill CTA, (3) uniform left-aligned blocks with equal top/bottom rhythm across items. Failure Theme: slightly long hero measure and limited link state variety; typographic palette is single-family. Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 1 (Charlie Deets). Deltas: this page uses serif vs grotesk; fewer hierarchy levels; less evident link-state system; otherwise similarly disciplined editorial rhythm. Score Justification: clean editorial minimalism with good hierarchy and rhythm; small issues keep it at 4.

Reconstruction: single-column grid (~640\u2013720px container) with consistent 24\u201340px vertical rhythm; clear reading path from intro blurb down through positions; headings, meta, and CTAs lock to the same column edges. Image presentation is largely absent, avoiding common mockup sloppiness. Link/State Audit: CTAs are consistently placed under each block; nav is stable and discoverable; no noisy modules. Consistency Map: (1) identical block structure per role, (2) steady margins and gutters across sections, (3) repeated pill CTA and intro-to-detail stacking. Failure Theme: conservative and somewhat template-like sectioning (repeated blocks) with limited structural variety and no product imagery to showcase complex layout decisions. Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 1. Deltas: simpler single-column vs Ex1\u2019s richer sections; fewer modules; less interactive structure; but similar discipline and spacing control.

Link/State Audit: accents are consistent but sparse\u2014no visible hover or secondary/tertiary distinctions. Consistency Map: (1) grayscale body/nav/CTAs, (2) one warm accent for emphasis, (3) consistent border tone for pills across sections. Failure Theme: under-specified role/color states (primary/secondary CTAs not clearly distinguished); very low chroma may reduce focal contrast on CTAs. Anchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 1.

Reconstruction: Type scale appears to be H1 (very large, tight tracking), H2 section headers, body around 16px with ~1.4\u20131.5 leading; hierarchy relies mostly on size/weight with limited tonal variation; rags are mostly clean; no obvious widows. Link/State Audit: CTAs are pill buttons; inline links styled as \u201cCase Study \u2192\u201d but hover/visited states aren\u2019t shown across sections.

Vertical rhythm is disrupted by large color blocks that are not baseline\u2011aligned with the devices.

[grid] Two post rows use a three-column line (year / title / date) with consistent rags and spacing.\nReconstruction: Type scale appears to have 3 levels (name/header ~20\u201324px, body ~16px, meta ~13\u201314px). Leading ~1.5 gives good readability; measure ~60\u201370ch. Hierarchy is mostly size + tint (gray for meta), limited display contrast; no secondary heading levels visible. Pairing is a single grotesk/system sans. Baseline rhythm and paragraph spacing look even.\nLink/State Audit: Inline links use blue with an external-link glyph; states beyond default (hover/visited) aren\u2019t demonstrated across sections.\nConsistency Map: repeated gray meta style; consistent inline link styling with icon; uniform three-column list alignment; matching paragraph spacing rhythm across sections.\nFailure Theme: Under-expressive hierarchy and likely default link styling reduce typographic character; minimal scale depth.\nAnchor Comparison: anchor: Exemplar 5 (Emil Kowalski). anchor_deltas: fewer heading levels; more default link treatment; less editorial scale/play; fewer sections shown. These deltas justify staying at 3 rather than higher.\nScore Justification: Readable and tidy but limited hierarchy and state proof keep this at the competent baseline.
