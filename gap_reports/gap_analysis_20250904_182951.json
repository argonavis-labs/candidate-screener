It needs a little bit more separation. \n\nThen there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. \n\nThey also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason.

Hierarchy is clear: large headline, small intro, then three columns with uppercase micro\u2011heads and tidy paragraphs. Line lengths and leading look comfortable; lists use a consistent teal link style with custom underline that matches the brand voice. No obvious widows/orphans or baseline drift. Minor nit: uppercase small heads may be slightly over\u2011tracked, and casing varies slightly between nav and CTA, but overall the system feels disciplined.",
        "layout_composition": "Solid, centered hero followed by a well\u2011spaced three\u2011column grid with consistent gutters and clear scan paths. Spacing rhythm feels even and the CTA sits cleanly below. However, the structure is conventional and evidence is limited to a single view; there\u2019s no demonstration of more complex sections, breakpoints, or asset harmonization beyond the intro. Strong but generic overall.",
        "color": "Harmonious palette with tuned neutrals: warm off\u2011white background, muted beige illustration mats, and a restrained teal accent used for nameplate, links, icons, and CTA outline. Values are controlled so type remains readable and illustrations sit comfortably in the shell. Consistency across elements suggests an intentional system."

Elements like 'See All Work' float without strong anchoring, and the overall page lacks a clear spacing system beyond generic large paddings.",
