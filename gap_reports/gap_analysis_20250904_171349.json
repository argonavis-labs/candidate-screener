Some of them even don't have a body, whereas others have a body and a title. They also kept the logos of the people that they work with really big, and every logo is a different type. Again, makes it really noisy. ",

        "color": "There are too many colors going on here, it's kind of a disaster.\n- There's an attempt at doing a pastel color background for all the images, but because there's so many colors in the UI in the foreground, it effectively loses the effect.\n- They also kept all the logos of the clients they work with really big, and because all the logos have different colors too, it just totally takes away from the intended effect of the pastel palette.\n- There's also some really awkward examples of color usage at the very bottom of the page where they've used full-color social logos (which is already a lot) and on top of it, they've chosen to use a colored outline in teal, which is like tons of color that doesn't mean anything and in a place where it's probably not very important to draw attention to.

Measures look comfortable (~55\u201370ch) and leading is even. Repeated micro\u2011labels in small caps/uppercase provide a consistent meta style. However, casing and scale vary without a clear system ('OTHER PROJECTS' is oversized all\u2011caps with wide tracking, while other headings are sentence case), link styling is not evident or customized in the nav, and some tiles mix brand type treatments with body styles causing voice shifts. Overall competent but generic.",
        "layout_composition": "A disciplined card mosaic shows a clear grid: two balanced tiles on row one, a full\u2011width feature row, then two balanced tiles, all with consistent gutters and aligned edges. Internal composition generally feels intentional (left text blocks with consistent insets; devices/images arranged to the right). Rhythm across rows is steady and scanning is easy. Minor roughness: the phone mock on the TopHatter tile nearly kisses the right edge and feels heavy; a black strip at the bottom of one tile introduces visual weight that breaks the otherwise light rhythm; internal margins vary slightly across tiles. Still, the page presents a strong, coherent structure.",
        "color": "Pastel tile backgrounds (lavender, peach, light blue) create a pleasant, soft shell and maintain adequate contrast with off\u2011black text. Accent use is restrained and footer icons sit in a gentle teal that matches the overall tone. Yet the diverse brand colors inside screenshots (purple logo wordmark, bright greens, multicolor posters) introduce some palette noise, and the occasional black bar within a tile spikes the value contrast. Harmonious overall but without a unifying tint/border system that would lift it further."

Footer microcopy is small, light grey, and evenly spaced, maintaining a clean hierarchy without proliferation of styles.

Hierarchy is serviceable but generic, with limited evidence of tuned rhythm or custom link states. Limitation: copy remains legible and sizes are sensible overall.",

While the grid is basically aligned, there\u2019s little evidence of a coherent spacing system or bespoke structure. Limitation: overall flow is scannable and alignment to the main column is consistent.",
        "color": "Color system lacks cohesion. 1) Shell uses stark white with near\u2011black text; neutrals don\u2019t appear tuned. 2) Accents are unclear: a lone coral 'Contact' pill is not repeated elsewhere; links and labels don\u2019t share a defined accent scheme. 3) Project tiles introduce disparate mats (cool blue, neutral grey, warm beige) plus a dark phone render, causing value and hue flicker as you scroll; blue\u2011heavy screenshots clash with the coral accent, with no unifying borders or tints.

But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. ",

Body copy blocks sit at a comfortable narrow measure with ~1.5 leading; section labels in small caps repeat consistently.
