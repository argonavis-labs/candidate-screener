It probably is not the most important thing on this page. And also it's in awkward all caps and a font that doesn't look very good all capped. \n\nAnd then the images - all the text is different sizes and different. Some of them even don't have a body, whereas others have a body and a title. They also kept the logos of the people that they work with really big, and every logo is a different type. Again, makes it really noisy. ",

        "color": "There are too many colors going on here, it's kind of a disaster.\n- There's an attempt at doing a pastel color background for all the images, but because there's so many colors in the UI in the foreground, it effectively loses the effect.\n- They also kept all the logos of the clients they work with really big, and because all the logos have different colors too, it just totally takes away from the intended effect of the pastel palette.\n- There's also some really awkward examples of color usage at the very bottom of the page where they've used full-color social logos (which is already a lot) and on top of it, they've chosen to use a colored outline in teal, which is like tons of color that doesn't mean anything and in a place where it's probably not very important to draw attention to.

Preflight findings: template cues \u22653 (emoji \u201cI\u2019m a \u2026\u201d hero, billboard\u2011style \u201cOTHER PROJECTS\u201d background words, boilerplate footer with centered social icons); sloppy cues: 1 (small, largely unreadable device UI in Tophatter tile). Reconstruction (Type Scale): Single sans family; display H1/H2 for project titles, H3 for subtitles, body copy around short 1\u20132 lines, micro\u2011labels in small caps; line height appears comfortable (~1.4\u20131.6) with no collisions; casing varies (Title Case vs ALL CAPS section header). Hierarchy/Readability/Consistency/Micro\u2011craft: 1) Hierarchy = 3 (clear but conventional; relies on size and a rule); 2) Readability = 3 (measures look fine; adequate contrast); 3) Consistency = 3 (repeated rule + label pattern, but casing and title scales vary across tiles); 4) Micro\u2011craft = 2 (no visible link styling, underline tuning, or baseline proof; quotation/punctuation details not evident). Link/State Audit: Nav and in\u2011tile links/CTAs show no explicit states; links look like plain text\u2014state logic not demonstrated. Consistency Map: \u2022 Repeated thin divider under brand names across multiple tiles. \u2022 Title + short description + small uppercase meta pattern. \u2022 Pastel mats behind each project card. \u2022 Left\u2011text/right\u2011artifact tile appears more than once. Failure Theme: Generic sans with limited state treatment; oversized display moments compete with smaller labels; lack of link/state polish. Anchor Comparison: Closest anchors = candidate_9.jpg and candidate_33.jpg (both 3/3/3). Deltas: similar generic sans voice; comparable hierarchy clarity; similar absence of tuned link states; this page\u2019s giant billboard header adds variability rather than refinement. Score Justification: Evidence is single\u2011view and template_scent_high cap applies (Typography \u22643). Weak micro\u2011craft keeps it at the competent baseline.",

Preflight findings: template cues \u22653 (emoji intro hero; billboard background words; boilerplate footer); sloppy cues: 1 (tiny unreadable device UI). Reconstruction (Grid/Spacing): Likely a fixed container with ~2 equal columns and consistent horizontal gutters; vertical spacing is regular between rows; card edges square with uniform internal padding; captions are integrated rather than separate. Reading path is straightforward but conventional, relying on a template card grid and one full\u2011width band. Link/State Audit: Project tiles appear clickable but lack explicit hover/active affordances; CTAs are absent. Consistency Map: \u2022 Consistent card gutters and edge alignment across rows. \u2022 Repeated divider rule and small meta label in multiple tiles. \u2022 Alternation between 2\u2011col rows and an occasional full\u2011width band is repeated once. Failure Theme: Template card grid with minimal bespoke decisions; one device mock too small to be useful; billboard section interrupts rhythm more than it helps. Anchor Comparison: Closest anchors = candidate_9.jpg and candidate_33.jpg (both 3 in layout). Deltas: similar simple grid and spacing discipline; similar lack of bespoke harmonization for assets; small device mock reduces information value.

Preflight findings: template cues present; no color\u2011specific sloppy caps (no mismatched whites or heavy shadows). Reconstruction (Unification & State Logic): Shell is neutral white/near\u2011white; accents come from project\u2011specific mats rather than a single unified palette. Neutrals read default\u2011ish; borders/shadows are minimal or absent. No explicit link/CTA state color system is shown. Link/State Audit: Links/CTAs are not visually distinct; no hover/visited/active cues evident. Consistency Map: \u2022 Repeated use of soft pastel backgrounds to differentiate projects. \u2022 Thin black/near\u2011black text across all tiles ensures contrast. \u2022 Occasional small gray rule used consistently. Failure Theme: Color varies per card without a unifying chrome strategy; states and roles are not expressed via color; some value flicker between very light mats and white page but not egregious. Anchor Comparison: Closest anchors = candidate_9.jpg and candidate_33.jpg (both 3 in color). Deltas: similar reliance on project imagery/mats; similar conservative neutrals without tuned states; no added refinement like tinted borders or unified mats. Score Justification: Palette is serviceable and harmonious enough for baseline, but missing state logic and unifying tactics keep it at 3."

        "typography": "They used a pretty interesting serif here that I think is a sign that they have thought about this. The body also uses a relatively interesting looking model. But the problem is that the way that they use it is kind of bad. For example, a lot of the details around their bulleted list which is too indented, right? There's too much space on the left of their bullets. This subtracts points. The fact that they use a model only for their body is not great. Generally, you don't want to use a model for body text. It makes it a little hard to read. There's also a little bit of overuse of all caps and random tracking. If you look at the work writing dribble about navigation, they have just increased the letter spacing for no really good reason. Similarly, in the navbar, their name is a little too big in contrast to the rest of the navbar and competes with their main title. ",
        "layout_composition": "The layout suffers from the typical sort of every section has a different width problem, but no intentionality.

Hierarchy uses size + weight + casing consistently. Link/State Audit: Links appear in a customized teal with a thinner\u2011than\u2011default underline and comfortable offset; lists and intro share the same link style; CTA is a bordered button in accent color implying primary/outline state logic; nav likely uses same accent for hover (implied by color system). Consistency Map: (1) Same serif display face for nameplate/hero; (2) Single sans for body, lists, and buttons; (3) Repeated uppercase micro\u2011labels in nav and column headers; (4) Teal underlined links repeat in intro and all three columns; (5) Bullet alignment and paragraph spacing are even across columns. Failure Theme: Limited proof of edge cases/states given single view; otherwise disciplined editorial minimal. Anchor Comparison: Closest anchors: exemplar_1 (4/4/4) and candidate_33 (3/3/3).

Reconstruction (Grid/Spacing): Single main container with consistent left alignment; three equal columns with even gutters (~24\u201332px); vertical rhythm holds from tiles to headings to lists; tiles share matched radii and internal mats; CTA aligns to center with balanced padding and border radius. Link/State Audit: Primary CTA uses accent border and center placement; text links remain inline; nav items grouped and spaced evenly, implying consistent clickable areas. Consistency Map: (1) Identical tile ratios/mats across three columns, (2) Even column gutters and aligned baselines for headers/lists, (3) Repeated section recipe (tile \u2192 micro\u2011heading \u2192 paragraph \u2192 list), (4) CTA consistently styled and positioned, (5) Header/nav alignment to container edges. Failure Theme: Slight template scent in overall hero structure and only one breakpoint/view visible; otherwise controlled. Anchor Comparison: Nearest anchor exemplar_1 (layout 4).

Preflight: no mismatched whites/mats or harsh default blues; no caps. Reconstruction (Unification & State Logic): Neutrals are tuned (not pure #000/#fff); accents are sparingly applied for interactive elements (links, CTA, nav emphasis); beige mats unify the illustration row and soften contrast. Link/State Audit: Inline links use teal with matching underlines; CTA uses teal stroke/text for primary action; nav likely follows same accent on hover/active (implied by consistent accent discipline).

I see a small size. I see three sizes. I also see two different weights. I see italics too. And then there's a color change in the typography too.

Title-case appears consistent across items; ranges use an en dash (e.g., 2024\u201325) and centered dot separators. No visible link underlines or state styling in this view. Reconstruction (Type Scale): H1 (name) ~20\u201324px medium/semibold; subtitle/body ~14\u201316px regular; secondary nav ~13\u201314px with reduced contrast; project titles ~16\u201318px semibold; meta lines ~13\u201314px with increased leading (~1.4\u20131.6).

Reconstruction (Unification & State Logic): Neutrals are clean but read as near\u2011pure #000/#fff; borders/dividers, if present, are extremely light or absent; link/CTA state colors are not explicitly shown. The M/L control uses neutral fill/outline for state rather than hue. Link/State Audit: No clear link color system or hover/visited logic is evidenced in the static shots; CTAs rely on neutral shapes rather than a color role. Consistency Map: (1) Consistent white page background; (2) black typographic chrome; (3) accents are mostly inside imagery, not the shell. Failure Theme: Value flicker from highly saturated/dark tiles with no mat/unifying border tint; lack of a visible accent color and state logic limits cohesion.

It's fine as a body font, but it's not great and it's really not that good when it's used as a header. So when she says, \"Hello, I'm Hayley\" in that big font, it really doesn't work that well. \n\nThere's some random bolding right so like if you look at read the sentence I'm a multi-faceted UX designer based in the Bay Area. UX designer is bolded, there's not a really good reason why it should, but it is.\n\nUsing an emoji as a center of the site as a focal point is also poor taste.

This creates a lot of white space towards the right side. Work and about are top-aligned, but then the social icons are center-aligned. This inconsistency creates some ugly white space. ",

They do it in some places but not others. \n\nThey use emojis instead of bullet points which creates noise and adds a weird indent on the left. Emojis are not always bad, but they were using them pretty badly here. \n\nThere's missing spacing between the bolded three lines and the stuff underneath it. It needs a little bit more separation. \n\nThen there's too much spacing between the case study text, so there's like a title and then there's a lot of space and then there's a label and then there's a lot of space again. But because the label is so small that it makes the spacing look even bigger, so that I would have probably put the label on top of the header text in the case study sections. \n\nThey also use a completely different model space font for the button for no apparent reason. And then the button outline also doesn't match the stroke width of the text inside the button or frankly anything else on the page. ",
        "layout_composition": "The layout is another one of those examples of just different for every section.\n- The navbar is super wide\n- It narrows down into the hero section (which is fine)\n- It broadens a little wider again in the body where there's like case studies\nI think that the hero and the case study section are technically the same width, but because the text on the hero doesn't run all the way to the right, it feels like it's not the same width. This creates this very awkward and inconsistent right rag.",
        "color": "There is sort of like an attempt here at doing sort of like an electric blue driven theme here, but because the case studies are also that backgrounds are sort of completely different colors and then they are very loud.\n\nWe're seeing gradients, we're seeing orange, we're seeing very dark blacks. It just takes away from the overall power of the monochrome plus electric blue color palettes. "

        "color": "Observations: \u2022 White shell with a single strong cobalt accent (hero link and large footer); pastel mats (light blues/peach) unify screenshots; black text with gray meta. \u2022 Outline CTAs remain neutral, avoiding color noise; imagery of varied palettes sits comfortably on the white page. Reconstruction (Unification & State Logic): Primary role = cobalt accent; secondary neutrals = off\u2011white background, near\u2011black text, soft gray labels; mats de\u2011saturate and buffer colorful UIs. Footer uses the same cobalt for an intentional brand hit with white text. Link/State Audit: Text links use blue; CTAs are neutral outlines; explicit hover/visited not shown but role clarity is consistent.

I think the approach here is a little bit of elevated basics. It uses a lot of the sort of browser default of black and blue but just does them slightly better. You can tell from the line spacing and the general restraint in the color usage and the stop restraint in the number of styles that it's a someone who is good at typography but didn't necessarily want to push it super far in this specific design. ",

And generally, I think that there is good use of white space here to create hierarchy and sections. They use a restrained amount of visuals, but all the visuals have a consistent style and layout that is effective. Because the visuals are really strong, they've kept the typography and the layout relatively minimal, which I think was an effective strategy. ",

Observations: (1) Intro paragraph and section copy use a neutral sans with comfortable measure (~60\u201370ch) and even leading. (2) In the Icons grid, each tile shows a blue-linked title with a lighter gray year label; in Software/Work sections, links are the same blue and set inline in short paragraphs/lists. Reconstruction \u2014 Type Scale: H1 (name) modest; H2 section labels (Icons, Software, Work) only a small step above body; body text regular weight; meta labels (years) lighter/secondary tone. Leading appears ~1.4; casing is sentence case; rags are tidy. Hierarchy relies mostly on size + color rather than nuanced weight/spacing. Link/State Audit: Links appear as a single blue treatment across hero text, tile titles, and lists; no visible hover/visited differentiation or tuned underline weight/offset. Consistency Map: (1) Repeated pattern of Title (blue link) + Year (gray) under every icon tile. (2) Same link treatment reused in Software/Work lists. (3) Uniform paragraph spacing and sentence-case headings across sections. Failure Theme: generic system typography with light hierarchy; reliance on default blue links and minimal scale steps. Anchor Comparison: Closest anchors = candidate_9.jpg / candidate_33.jpg (both 3/3/3). Versus those, this page matches their competent rhythm and consistency; it lacks the tuned underlines, distinct scale steps, or typographic voice seen in stronger anchors like exemplar_1.jpg (4). Deltas vs exemplar_1: (1) Links look default; (2) small size jumps between headings/body; (3) no visible state system or underline tuning.

(2) Software/Work/Featured sections switch to a single centered column of text links with consistent container width and spacing. Reconstruction \u2014 Grid/Spacing: Single centered container; Icons grid likely 2 cols with regular gutters; consistent caption spacing from tile edge; sections separated by even vertical spacing. Captions align left with stable baselines. No evidence of breakpoint decisions or complex asymmetric handling.

(2) Repeated caption pattern (Title + Year) aligned consistently. (3) Section rhythm: heading, content block, then next heading with equal spacing. Failure Theme: clean but generic gallery; limited page-level point of view; supporting sections are plain lists without structural nuance. Anchor Comparison: Closest anchors = candidate_9.jpg / candidate_33.jpg (layout 3). Compared to exemplar_1.jpg (layout 4), this lacks bespoke image handling beyond basic mats, no complex grid or caption systems, and no visible breakpoint variety.

(2) Blue link color appears consistently for titles and inline links; years are a muted gray. Reconstruction \u2014 Unification & State Logic: Single-accent scheme (blue links) with neutral body; light gray text for meta; mats are white with subtle border/shadow, which successfully normalizes many colorful icons. No evidence of tuned off-whites, tinted borders, or hover/visited states. Link/State Audit: Accent role = links only; states not shown or implied beyond default. Consistency Map: (1) Blue link accent repeats across tiles and lists. (2) Gray meta labels are consistent under every icon. (3) White mats unify diverse icon hues without value flicker. Failure Theme: default-minimal palette; lacks nuanced neutrals and state logic beyond a single accent. Anchor Comparison: Closest anchors = candidate_9.jpg / candidate_33.jpg (color 3).
