<evaluation_rules>

1. Scoring posture (critical, calibrated, and specific):

   - Default anchor is 3 (Average/Competent). Start every dimension at 3 when the work is readable and basically organized, then move up or down strictly on visible evidence.
   - Be skeptical of “tidy but generic.” If you note default link styles, stock modules, mixed alignments, or more than one small inconsistency, round down rather than up.
   - Do not award 4–5 for “neat” or “not broken.” Scores 4–5 require visible refinement across multiple sections and/or a distinctive, coherent point of view that improves clarity and cohesion.
   - Evidence‑limited views: When only a single hero or single section is visible, cap each dimension at 3 unless either the Minimalism Micro‑Craft Check or the Elevated Basics Check passes (see Rule 2). Never award 5 without multiple sections, or unless the visible section shows unmistakable master‑level micro‑craft.
   - Caps from red flags apply (see Rules 7 and 9). Template scent without strong counter‑evidence caps Typography and Layout at 3. Three or more sloppy image cues cap Layout at 2 and can pull Color to 2 when mismatched mats/whites cause flicker.

2. Two ways a single refined view can justify a 4 (you must explicitly verify the signals):

   - Minimalism Micro‑Craft Check (pass when ≥4 signals are present):
     - Tuned neutrals (off‑black/off‑white; borders/shadows show hue shifts and controlled values).
     - Customized link styling (non‑default hue and underline thickness/offset; clear hover or convincingly consistent implied state).
     - Measured typographic rhythm (predictable ratio steps; stable baseline; no widows/orphans; intentional hyphenation and rags; consistent punctuation and casing).
     - Intentional spacing system (e.g., 4/8/12 multiples; even row rhythm; no accidental half‑gutter gaps).
     - Optical alignment corrections (icons aligned to x‑height/caps; bullets/dividers centered optically; numerals/symbols sit correctly).
     - Hierarchy achieved with minimal styles (tone/weight/spacing) yet unambiguous; labels/meta styles repeat exactly.
     - Disciplined image/list presentation (matching aspect ratios, radii, mats, caption positions; no random white balances; no emoji bullets or novelty icons as structure).
     - Cohesive bespoke touches (e.g., editorial serif paired with care; caret/arrow icons aligned to cap height; button strokes that match surrounding type weight; no default blue).
   - Elevated Basics Check (for default‑leaning but tuned designs; pass when ≥5 signals are present):
     - Comfortable measures (45–80ch body) and consistent 1.3–1.7 leading; display leading tighter but non‑colliding.
     - Consistent link treatment even if conservative; underline weight/offset intentional; states visible or plausibly consistent.
     - Neutrals feel considered (soft grey dividers, off‑black text); no harsh pure #000/#fff pairs; shadows/borders with subtle tints.
     - Repetition handled with discipline (long card/icon grids keep identical mats, radii, border weights, caption rhythm).
     - Clear text scale system (predictable size/weight steps) repeated across sections; punctuation/quotes consistent; no random bolding to simulate hierarchy.
     - Accents are sparse and role‑clear; imagery carries color without clashing; mats/borders unify diverse screenshots.
     - No sloppy artifacts (no jaggies/compression; crops and radii match; consistent shadow/border logic; no unreadable screenshots; device frames avoided or customized with readable content).

3. Score each dimension on a 1–5 scale:

   - 1: Poor
   - 2: Below average
   - 3: Average (competent baseline)
   - 4: Strong (refined and intentional)
   - 5: Exceptional (rare, masterful, and original)

4. For each dimension, you MUST:

   - Provide a score (1–5).
   - Write a concise explanation citing at least 3 concrete visual observations (e.g., “even 56–64ch measure,” “underline offset aligns to x‑height,” “tile radii unified at 12px; borders 1px with subtle hue shift,” “device mock crops cut off status bar,” “center/left alignment alternates without grid reason”).
   - Call out at least one limitation, even for scores ≥4, to avoid uncritical praise.
   - Rate your confidence (1–5). If evidence is partial (e.g., only a hero or one section), set confidence ≤3.

5. Avoid context bias:

   - Ignore brands, company names, and content substance.
   - Evaluate only visible visual execution and design craft.

6. Be consistent with exemplars:

   - Use exemplar ratings as calibration anchors.
   - Apply the same standard across evaluations. Minimal, text‑forward pages can earn 4–5 when micro‑craft is clearly elevated (see Rule 2), especially when large, repeated grids show flawless rhythm and alignment across sections.
   - Important: “Gallery/collage” layouts may be strong when variation is obviously intentional and rhythm is controlled (consistent caption system, repeatable gutters/mats, optical alignment). Do not punish considered variation; punish sloppy inconsistency.

7. Check for red flags and list them when present:

   - template_scent_high
   - sloppy_images
   - process_soup
   - When you flag any red flag, cite at least two matching cues from the lists in Rule 9 in your explanations. Apply the related caps and be conservative with scores.

8. Innovation vs. basic competence:

   - Do not award 4–5 for centered heroes, uniform grids, outline “VIEW PROJECT” buttons, or tidy device‑mock rows if they feel boilerplate or default. “Looks fine” is a 3.
   - Reward originality only when it improves comprehension and is executed with control (alignment, rhythm, hierarchy, and color remain strong). Subtle, disciplined systems that unify complex, varied imagery can be exceptional even with minimal styling.

9. Quick template and sloppiness scan (use to inform red flags and to avoid overrating):

   - Template scent visual cues (3+ suggests template_scent_high and cap Typography/Layout at 3 unless strong counter‑evidence exists):
     - Copy‑paste tokens from UI kits: identical 12/16px radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues/purples; default Inter/Roboto link blue with default underline/visited purple.
     - Stock hero patterns: “I’m [Name] …” or “Hi, I’m …” headline; centered “don’t be a stranger” footer; “See projects” down arrow; oversized personal nameplate in nav competing with hero.
     - Uncustomized layout modules: left text/right device hero; alternating light/dark bands; uniform 2‑column case rows with identical outline “VIEW” buttons; centered “CASE STUDIES” label above left‑aligned content; boilerplate footer; “Made with Framer/Webflow” badge.
     - Notion/Figma‑like blocks with unmodified dividers/toggles; generic device frames; cookie‑cutter badges/pill buttons with identical shadows; random handwriting doodle paired with default UI.
     - Unexplained switches between center/left alignment and inconsistent container widths that mirror theme defaults rather than page‑level decisions.
     - Background billboard words as filler; logos band with mixed sizes/colors acting as a section substitute.
     - Note: Do not flag solely for a centered hero and grid if there is clear bespoke tuning (consistent mats, tuned neutrals, customized links, optical alignment). Require 3+ concrete cues before flagging.
   - Sloppy execution cues (2+ suggests sloppy_images or pull scores down; if 3+ are present, cap Layout at 2 and consider Color 2 when mats/whites flicker):
     - Inconsistent crops/aspect ratios; mixed or mismatched corner radii; aliasing/jaggies; compression or non‑retina blur; screenshots too zoomed out to read; device mock content illegible.
     - Mixed device frames (phone/laptop/desktop) that dominate while diminishing readability; screenshots cut off or with thick internal mats that vary.
     - Shadow/border values fluctuate without logic; captions misaligned to tiles; stray 1–2px misalignments repeated; pixel wobble across grids; outline/button stroke weights that don’t match body text weight.
     - Masonry grids with irregular whitespace or gutters; logos or social icons oversized or full‑color in otherwise minimal sections; colored outlines around low‑priority elements drawing attention without purpose.
   - Process soup cues:
     - Long walls of sticky notes, personas, or unreadable timelines dominating above final visuals; deliverables with tiny text that cannot be evaluated; few or no polished product shots.

10. Execution checklist before scoring (to sharpen critique and reduce leniency):

- Typography:
  - Verify capitalization and casing consistency (nav vs headings vs labels; sentence case vs Title Case); inconsistent sentence starts are a deduction.
  - Look for random tracking/over‑tracked all‑caps; avoid “everything bold” or excessive bolding inside paragraphs to force emphasis.
  - Identify vertical divider abuse (dividers taller/heavier than adjacent text), emoji as bullets, over‑indented lists, and sloppy rags/widows/orphans.
  - Link treatment: hue, underline thickness/offset, visited/hover cues; penalize default blue with default underline.
  - Pairing logic: avoid display/editorial or monospace for body; detect mixed fonts in buttons vs body; ensure button stroke weights match type weight.
  - Confirm measure/leading (45–80ch; 1.3–1.7); flag heroes exceeding ~90ch as too long.
- Layout & Composition:
  - Grid/gutter consistency; container width logic across sections (nav vs hero vs body). Penalize drift such as wide nav → narrow hero → wider body with no rationale.
  - Alignment discipline: avoid unjustified center/left switches; detect rag/edge drift that makes same‑width sections read as mismatched; note floaty CTAs.
  - Image framing: mats, border weights, corner radii; detect generic device mocks and small unreadable screenshots; ensure no crops are cut off.
  - Repetition checks: identical caption positions and offsets; consistent tile aspect ratios; beware irregular masonry or collage with flickering whitespace.
- Color:
  - Tuned neutrals vs harsh #000/#fff; accent role clarity and consistency; link/CTA state logic.
  - Unification tactics: mats/borders/shadow tints that harmonize diverse imagery; avoid bright footers or tiles that jump in value and break the system.
  - Penalize noisy additions: full‑color social/client logos in minimal shells; colored outlines around icons/logos; pastel mats that fail to tame saturated UI.

## Scoring Calculation

- base_score = (typography × 0.35) + (layout_composition × 0.35) + (color × 0.30)
- penalty = sum of red flag penalties:
  - template_scent_high: 0.6 points
  - sloppy_images: 0.5 points
  - process_soup: 0.2 points
- overall_weighted_score = base_score - penalty
- overall_confidence = average of individual dimension confidences

<rubric>

Follow this rubric strictly. The “Score 3” rows define the competent baseline. Use 4–5 only when criteria are clearly met across multiple sections, or when a single view passes Rule 2. Default to 3 when evidence is mixed, default‑ish, or generic.

<typography_criteria weight="35%">

What to examine (look closely and cite specifics):

- Typeface quality (pro‑grade vs overused free), appropriateness, and pairing logic.
- Hierarchy via scale ratios, weight, spacing, and tone—not only bolding.
- Readability: body 45–80ch; line‑height 1.3–1.7; display sizes tighter leading without collisions.
- Consistency: heading levels, list styles, link treatment (underline thickness/offset), baseline rhythm, quote punctuation and apostrophes, superscripts/subscripts alignment, casing/capitalization patterns.
- Micro‑craft: optical kerning for all‑caps; punctuation spacing; small‑caps quality; number alignment; hyphenation/rag control.

Score 5: Exceptional

- A minimal style set produces rich, unmistakable hierarchy with impeccable rhythm across sections.
- Pairing (or single family) shows mastery; details tuned (optical alignment, kerning, consistent cap/ascender spacing; intentional hyphenation; no widows/orphans; bullets align; lists indent cleanly).
- Distinctive typographic voice that feels bespoke yet highly readable. Link/label systems are rigorously consistent, including states and edge cases.

Score 4: Strong

- Clear hierarchy with restrained, consistent styles; comfortable measures and leading across sections.
- Evident scale system (e.g., modular ratios) across multiple elements; link styling is customized and consistent or convincingly intentional even when conservative.
- Elevated basics allowed: a common system sans/serif can earn 4 if rhythm, measures, punctuation, casing, and link treatment are disciplined and repeat.
- Minor issues only (e.g., a slightly hot link hue, one tight display line, a narrow rag).

Score 3: Competent baseline

- Readable with adequate hierarchy and a limited style set; may feel generic.
- Choices can be default‑ish (system sans + near‑default link blue) but aren’t broken.
- Some inconsistencies: heading levels too close; uneven bullet spacing/indentation; occasional baseline drift; a widow/orphan; inconsistent smart quotes; one instance of over‑tracked all‑caps; small nav/hero mismatches kept in check.

Score 2: Below average

- Multiple issues that reduce polish and clarity:
  - Inconsistent capitalization/casing across similar elements or sentences; “everything bold” effect; random word‑level bolding to force emphasis.
  - Emoji used as bullets creating irregular indents/line height; over‑indented lists; tall/heavy vertical dividers that overpower labels.
  - Random tracking or overuse of all‑caps; display/editorial or monospace used for body; mixed font in CTAs/buttons vs body.
  - Link styling clearly default with thick default underline; mixed link treatments; no visible state logic.
  - Repeated widows/orphans, sloppy rags, or unstable baselines across sections.
- Voice reads generic or junior despite basic legibility.

Score 1: Poor

- Flat or confusing hierarchy; style proliferation; unreadable measures (very long/very tight lines, e.g., hero ~90–100ch); collisions/overlaps; inconsistent quotes/apostrophes and punctuation; numerous broken lists/labels.

Negative indicators that should pull to 2 (or 1 when frequent):

- Default link blue with default underline and no tuning; mixed serif/sans without logic; visible reflow collisions; inconsistent quotation marks/apostrophes; mismatched button font/outline; button stroke weights that don’t match text; oversized nameplate in nav.

How to distinguish refined minimal vs generic minimal type:

- Refined: tuned neutrals; customized underline weight/offset; disciplined scale steps; stable baselines; optical alignment of icons/marks; consistent micro‑labels and dates; intentional hyphenation; bullets align neatly with text blocks; casing consistently applied.
- Generic: default link blue and underline; uneven paragraph spacing; arbitrary size jumps; mixed alignment without rationale; "Notion export" vibes with unmodified toggles/dividers; emoji bullets; oversized or over‑tracked all‑caps; nav/hero sizing competition.

</typography_criteria>

<layout_criteria weight="35%">

What to examine:

- Grid usage: columns, gutters, container widths; spacing system (multiples of 4/8/12).
- Structural clarity: section breaks, scan patterns, focal points, navigation affordances.
- Image presentation: consistent crops, device‑frame consistency or bespoke mats; matching radii/border weights/shadows; readable screenshots.
- Innovation with control: novel structures that aid comprehension; restraint that still shows a point of view.
- Breadth of evidence: multiple sections vs single hero; consistency across the page and at visible breakpoints.

Score 5: Exceptional

- Masterful structure with a clear POV that elevates clarity (inventive yet disciplined layouts, precise orchestration across columns/sections).
- Immaculate rhythm and alignment at visible breakpoints; optical fixes for asymmetric content; complex, long grids stay perfectly in sync.
- Assets are harmonized (radii, borders, shadows, captions) with flawless consistency across diverse content; complex grids remain legible and elegant. Minimal pages with large, repeated galleries can earn 5 when mats/captions/gutters are exact.

Score 4: Strong

- Consistent grid and spacing; clear section hierarchy; strong alignment across sections.
- Image/asset handling is deliberate and cohesive; cards/tiles feel unified and intentional.
- Long repeated grids are disciplined (identical mats, radii, caption positions, gutter rhythm).
- Minor roughness allowed (one floaty element, a narrow gutter anomaly, or a single misaligned caption corrected elsewhere).
- Important: Uniform card grids can earn 4 only when mats/radii/spacing are notably refined and captions/labels are disciplined. Otherwise default to 3.
- Considered collage is acceptable: variable tile sizes may earn 4 when gutters, baselines, and caption styles repeat exactly and no crops are cut off.

Score 3: Competent baseline

- Basic grid present and mostly consistent; sections are readable with adequate spacing.
- Common patterns (single column, centered hero, simple card grid, left‑text/right‑image hero) executed decently but without sophistication or a clear POV.
- Some inconsistencies in gutters, container widths, vertical rhythm, or image placement; default device frames with light tuning.

Score 2: Below average

- Noticeable structural problems:
  - Container width drift across sections (e.g., wide nav → narrow hero → wide body) with no rationale, or perceived width mismatches caused by ragged edges or off‑grid content.
  - Unexplained switches between center and left alignment; awkward rags; floaty CTAs not tied to grid.
  - Masonry or collage tiles with inconsistent whitespace; irregular bottoms/tops; crops cut off.
  - Reliance on generic device mocks where screenshots are small/unreadable; mixed tile aspect ratios produce rhythm flicker; inconsistent internal mats.
  - Oversized headings/labels that overpower content; misaligned buttons/captions; billboard background words crowding real content.
- Layout reads like an uncustomized template or a pile of modules.

Score 1: Poor

- Random placement; competing focal points; inconsistent container widths and gutters; severe readability issues.
- Haphazard screenshot handling; inconsistent radii/shadows; elements hugging edges or overflowing at visible breakpoints.

Common deductions and caps:

- Evidence limited to a single hero or short view: cap at 3 unless Rule 2 passes.
- “Clean but generic”: centered hero + simple grid with soft shadows/rounded corners and no POV—do not exceed 3 without visible refinement (precise rhythm, tuned mats, optical alignment).
- Template modules repeated with little customization: cap at 3 and consider template_scent_high.
- If sloppy_images cues ≥3 (cut‑offs, unreadable device mocks, mixed radii/crops), cap Layout at 2 and pull Color down when grid flicker is caused by mismatched whites/mats.

</layout_criteria>

<color_criteria weight="30%">

What to examine:

- Palette quality: harmony, hue/value control, and consistency across sections.
- Neutrals: tuned greys/blacks; hue‑shifted borders and shadows; subtle overlays.
- Accent strategy: scarcity and consistency; link/CTA states; role clarity.
- Integration with imagery: does the shell unify diverse screenshots/tiles (mats, border tints, shadow logic, sequencing)?

Score 5: Exceptional

- Sophisticated palette with precise value control; accents sparse yet highly effective.
- Neutrals and shadows are tuned; borders/overlays have intentional tints; color choices unify varied content effortlessly, including complex artwork.
- Color expresses identity without noise, consistently across sections and states.

Score 4: Strong

- Harmonious palette with controlled accents; link/CTA system clearly defined or convincingly implied by consistent usage.
- Neutrals intentionally tuned (off‑black/off‑white) supporting readability and hierarchy; gradients/illustrations sit comfortably within the system.
- Elevated basics acceptable: conservative blue accent can qualify for 4 when mats, borders, and greys are tuned and unify colorful content.
- Minor issues only (one accent slightly hot, a single mismatched gradient, a bright footer that is close to acceptable, or limited state evidence).

Score 3: Competent baseline

- Serviceable palette; minimal shell with a single accent or defaultish link blue used acceptably.
- When colorful tiles carry most color, the chrome does not clash but lacks unifying tactics (e.g., inconsistent mats/shadows/border tints) that would lift it to 4.
- States may be missing but implied by stable patterns.

Score 2: Below average

- Too many hues or values with little throughline; loud tiles overpower a claimed single‑accent scheme.
- Flat untuned greys; harsh #000/#fff pairs; default bright link blue; inconsistent state colors.
- Mixed tile backgrounds and mismatched whites causing grid flicker; full‑color social icons or client logos add unnecessary noise; colored outlines around low‑importance elements.
- Pastel mats attempted but overwhelmed by saturated foreground content; jumpy sections like a saturated footer that breaks the page’s value structure.

Score 1: Poor

- Clashing gradients; muddy overlays; illegible contrast; chaotic use of color without role clarity.

Negative indicators that should pull to 2:

- Pure #000/#fff with harsh 0,0,255‑like blue; mismatched tile backgrounds; muddy overlays; random hover colors; inconsistent visited link behavior; pastel mats that fail to unify because foreground UIs are extremely saturated; social logo rows or multicolor client badges pulling attention without purpose; aggressive value jumps (e.g., cobalt footer shock).

How to spot tuned vs default color in minimal pages:

- Tuned: slightly desaturated or hue‑shifted blue; consistent underline thickness/offset; hover/visited handled or implied by pattern; off‑black/off‑white neutrals; very light, even dividers; unified mats/shadows around images.
- Default: pure black/white; harsh default blues; generic heavy shadows; inconsistent border tints; tiles with different corner radii or shadow directions; color‑heavy logos/emoji adding noise.

</color_criteria>

<red_flags>

Flag these when clearly present and reflect them in explanations. Only add a flag when you can name at least two matching cues from the lists above; otherwise omit and reduce confidence.

- template_scent_high:

  - Obvious boilerplate patterns with minimal customization: centered “I’m [Name]” hero with left text/right device, generic down arrow “See projects,” uniform 2‑column rows with outline “VIEW PROJECT” buttons, billboard background words, stock “About” block, boilerplate footer, default link styles and underlines, visible “Made with …” badge.
  - Tokens that mirror popular UI kits without page‑level decisions: identical 12/16px radii everywhere; 24/24 paddings; Tailwind/Bootstrap default blues; identical card shadows; Inter/Roboto with untouched link defaults; Notion‑style layouts with unmodified toggles and dividers; emoji bullets as structure; oversized personal nameplate in nav.
  - Repeated canned sections with identical structure, no bespoke visual decisions, and no tuning of mats, shadows, or link treatments; unexplained alternating center/left alignment and container widths that follow theme defaults.

- sloppy_images:

  - Inconsistent crops/aspect ratios; mixed/mismatched corner radii; aliasing/jaggies; compression artifacts; non‑retina blurriness; screenshots cut off or too zoomed out to read; tiny UI inside device frames.
  - Generic device frames without customization; screenshots small/unreadable inside mocks; inconsistent mats/shadows/border weights; white‑balance mismatch across tiles; irregular masonry gutters.
  - Misaligned captions/labels; inconsistent drop‑shadow directions; pixel wobble across a grid; outline/button strokes that do not match text weight; full‑color social/client logos used as graphic tiles without harmonization.

- process_soup:
  - Long timelines/diagrams overwhelming final visuals; walls of sticky‑note photos overshadowing product.
  - Persona/journey maps with unreadable small text; very little outcome imagery; excessive wireframes with no polished result.

Note: If uncertain, omit the flag and reduce confidence instead. If you do flag, list the cues you observed in your explanations.
