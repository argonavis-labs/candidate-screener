They use exactly one size across the entire website, but through the clever usage of just a slight difference in color between dark and gray, they managed to achieve all the hierarchy and visual distinction that they need. So really there is a level of restraint. Here that achieves all the goals it seeks out to achieve with very few elements which is elegant. They use shades of gray and then ample white space to create all the hierarchy that they need. The white space is also ample between elements, but it's not too much for the light height. Overall, really well done."

Overall, I think this is a strong example of color usage even though it's all monochrome."

Here are the signs why it's good:first, the site uses two typefaces from a relatively obscure but really high-quality foundry called NB International. I think this was a very intentional choice that works really well for the site in both the super large title case and also the small body case.It demonstrates a level of mastery of typefaces, even though there is not much going on. There's also a nice bit of detail where their age is displayed in a super rapidly shifting number with high decimals, which is a very subtle but good design choice."

And then the words in her top left nav. But she unfortunately doesn't carry it through to the rest of her site, so that the case study titles go back to this generic sans-serif which is not as interesting.In the case study themselves, there's also a little bit of just messy font type usage. For example, \"Selected work\" is the same size as \"Introducing a new homepage\" underneath. \"Selected work\" is clearly a higher heading level and should probably be a little bigger or different, but it looks kind of the same as the case study titles. And then the case study title has sort of a two-line underneath one which is a body which is well done, but then the other one is sort of some key results which then is stronger than the body text and it's a little too close to the body text which deducts points for me.The labels needed a little bit more separation, so top padding, and probably needed to be a little smaller and not competing with the body. Right now the label is bigger than the body, which probably shouldn't be the case.There's also minor details that make the type not as good. For example, the vertical bar is a little too strong between the labels."

The bio section is just a little wider than everything else, along with the footer, and there's not a really good reason for it. It doesn't feel super intentional to me, which is also not that great.But otherwise, I think the website pulls off an overall generally competent sort of like spacing, hierarchy, and clarity in terms of the layout. And sort of like I think that if you just look at the hero section at the top and the case studies, I think it's like decently executed.

So I see some mostly monochrome black and white here, but they've punctuated it with some blue and yellow. It's not super consistent, but it's consistent enough that there is a visual theme happening in general. There is also some use of background texture here. It's probably a little overdone, but the fact that it exists is a good sign, and it feels like they're able to use both color and texture. It's a little junior feeling, but not bad.They also have done some interesting gradient and noise work in the three little micro-images next to the words \"design\", \"code\", and \"art\". Again, this tells me that they have some experience working with color. They are not incredibly well done, but they show signs of promise. There are, however, still elements where I think there needs to be a little bit more refinement. For example, the divider line at the very end of her portfolio is too dark.And also, there are some awkward gradients at the car seller case study image that doesn't seem to match with the rest of the site, which is more flat. So minor mistakes, but overall I think it's showing promise in color usage."
