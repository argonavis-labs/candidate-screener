They create strong constrast between the title and the body, by making the title twice as large and bold, while using subtle changes in color to reflect the changes in hierarchy within the body text. The whole thing is set to system font, which further reinforces the minimal approach. While not original, it is well executed, achieving contrast and hierarchy with restraint"

The line width is set to make reading comfortable while also playing into the minimalism. Whitespace and high constrast typography is used to provide hierarchy, which keeps visual noise low, while still being clear. There are no visual flourishes, but everything is clear, clean, and well-executed"

It also two great paid typefaces (GT Alpina and Untitled Sans) which tells us that the candidate really thought through their choices.\n\nThe overall effect combination of typefaces achieve a good blend of elegance and simplicity"

Because the images are so important, the author has also taken care to design each one of them in intentional layouts.\n\nThe core concept of heavily image site is simple, but well-execute with adequate whitespace to create hierarchy, and subtle details like rounded corners for the screenshots to add a subtle flair."

Visual hierachy is also lacking due to poor use of line spacing. The site uses multiple weight, size, family, opacity without restraint, causing it to feel busy and incohesive."

The problem is that the author has put very busy screenshots of their work in small image boxes, which makes it feel busy and hard to read. There is insufficient differentiation between the case study sections and the author's bio, leading two distinct content sections to blend in together. The footer also randomly switches from full width content to narrow center aligned content."
